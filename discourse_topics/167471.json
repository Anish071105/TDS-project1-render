(On 15th Feb 1:26AM)\nThen when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections.\nThen once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations.\nThen you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=\u201c21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471\u201d]\nimage250\u00d7534 3.92 KB\n[/quote]\nshowing that your files are in the correct place.\nWe do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students.\nKind regards",

At that time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure if this was the actual issue, but it looks like it was.\nI understand that the deadline had already passed, and I only saw the email later. I had two GATE papers on the 15th and an interview on the 16th, so I was extremely busy and couldn\u2019t check my emails sooner. However, I had raised my concern well before making the correction, so I\u2019d really appreciate it if my submission could still be considered \nKind regards,\nArnav Mehta\n21f3002647",
