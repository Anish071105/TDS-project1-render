    "content": "Please post any discrepancies related to project1.\n@carlton\nWho were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?\nAll the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us.\nFor clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.\nHow to fix bugs in our scripts\nCreate Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 .\nDocker Image Architecture Issue Report\nIf your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form:\nSubmit Report\nBug fixes\nIf you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.\nKind regards,\nTDS Team",

As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as \u201ccan\u2019t read the file.\u201d\nI understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line?

    "content": "@23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.\nIf students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.\nWe have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.\nKind regards",

For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.\nIf yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.\nKind regards",

I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!\nGiven the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.",

    "content": "@Jivraj @carlton\nI\u2019m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.\nI have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.\nThese are the detailed point wise concerns :\n\n\nI at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it\u2019s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2\u00bd weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.\n\n\nBy this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn\u2019t receive a reply.\n\n\nI understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.\n\n\nI also didn\u2019t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.\n\n\nI have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn\u2019t process it) is very unfair.\nKindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.\nI hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.\nThanks and Regards",

    "content": "@carlton\nMy docker logs shows that OSError: Cannot find resource error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.\nimage1485\u00d7807 37.4 KB\nThe datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?\nimage302\u00d7252 3.45 KB\nI think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday\u2019s results mail.\nSo, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren\u2019t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .\nAlso, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don\u2019t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.\nThank you",

    "content": "Greetings, Sir,\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.\nThank you for your assistance!",

I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.\nFor Task B1. \u201cData outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.\u201d - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK\nERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt\nINFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - \"POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n\n\nSimilarly for task B2.\nINFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md\nERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md\nINFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - \"POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1\" 200 OK\n\nFor Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as \u2018main\u2019 branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.\nFor Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?\nBecause I see only \u201c=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting\u201d for Task B8",

I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.\nThis situation is particularly disheartening\u2014seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.\nI will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\nKind regards",

    "content": "@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.\nHowever, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.\nimage1272\u00d7395 25.7 KB\nBut here\u2019s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*\n\nImplementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models.\nImplementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.\nEnhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.\nAdding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent\u2019s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.\nDeploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI\u2019s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.\n\nAll this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent\u2014it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I\u2019m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you\u2014without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent.\n\nGiven all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it\u2019s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.\nTo clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.\nMy only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0\u2014since it was already evaluated and graded.\nWould highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj",

You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.\nWe have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.\nWe hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.\nKind regards",

    "content": "We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.\nWe discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.\nIn our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand\nSo unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.\nKind regards,\nTDS team",

    "content": "@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool\u2019s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That\u2019s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.\nI am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.\nAdditionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.\nGiven this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.\nScreenshot 2025-04-01 0206181335\u00d7667 57.9 KB",

The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. \nHowever with regards to your long post\u2026\nLet me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.\nWhat you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.\nIn fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?\n\nBecause it does not deliver what was required,\nWastes valuable time and resources\nIncreases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)\nComplicates testing\nLeads to scope creep\n\nHis advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.\nI hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.\nFor personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).\nKindest regards",

    "content": "Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It\u2019s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would\u2019ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.\nRegarding your point on gold plating \u2014 I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory \u2014 to explore the boundaries of what\u2019s possible within the scope of the problem statement.\nWhat began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. \n(\u2026caution: long post ahead )\nI noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use. While it would\u2019ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads. No two payloads are exactly alike \u2014 even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There\u2019s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.\nSome might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior \u2014 and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn\u2019t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn\u2019t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There\u2019s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.\nHardcoded tool agents also aren\u2019t really \u201cagents\u201d in my view\u2014 they\u2019re more like passive AI powered regex matchers: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to \u2018fix\u2019 them and keep calling them like a broken record.\nAt the core of it, it\u2019s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between \u2014 The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.\nSince most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,\n\nReason about the task, understand intent,\nReflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)\nExecute those workflows (walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.\nObserve the final result, and repeat if needed.\n\nInterestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.\nTo make environment interaction possible, the agent didn\u2019t need dozens of narrow tools \u2014 just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools:\n\nA REPL executor (for quick calcs)\nA Python script runner\nA Shell executor\n\nWith just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally \u2014 avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.\nAs for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) \u2014 that was emergent behavior, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I\u2019ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!\nI am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really!\nAs for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I\u2019ll be experimenting with\u2014 modalities.\nPS: I\u2019m not claiming it\u2019s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design. At this point, I\u2019m less concerned about the marks, I\u2019m actually enjoying the thought joyride. \n\nTL;DR\nMy approach doesn\u2019t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates \u2014 much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I\u2019ve only just wired the pieces together.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Respected Sir,\nThank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.\nSteps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment\nI cloned my repository using:\nbash\ngit clone <my_repo_url>\ncd <my_repo_directory>\nI built the Docker image using:\n\nbash\ndocker build -t.\nI ran the Docker container with:\n\nbash\ndocker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000\n\nI ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.\n\nFinally, I ran the evaluation script using:\n\nbash\nuvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000\n\nIssue with Original Submission\nAfter reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.\nHowever, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.\nI acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.\nAction Taken\nTo address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:\nThe application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.\nIt responds to requests within the required timeframe.\nI have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:\nDocker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest\nRequest for Re-Evaluation\nI kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.\nPrevious Message for Reference\nFor your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:\n\"Greetings, Sir,\nI would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.\nTo resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.\nI\u2019ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.\nThank you for your assistance!\"",

We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.",

However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.\nHad it been otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I\u2019m proud of the commitment I\u2019ve shown so far.\nWith utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there\u2019s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.",

We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.\nWe are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.\nA minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.\nCritical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.\nI know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.\nKindest regards",

    "content": "@carlton @jivraj @s.anand,\nI hope you\u2019re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.\nI understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I\u2019m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn\u2019t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.\nI do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students\u2014including myself\u2014it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.\nI sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I\u2019ve worked hard to demonstrate.\nI know you all have our best interests in mind, and I\u2019m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties\u2014especially for a single oversight\u2014can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.\nThank you for your time and understanding.",

    "content": "Dear @carlton\nThis is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the\n/app/app/main.py     file is missing. However, in my project directory, the\nmain.py   file is located in the   app/   folder, and the   run.py   file is in the root folder of the project, which is   LLM_Automation_Agent  . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py.\nTo run the project, the command I used is:\npython run.py\n\nSince run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py.\nI believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder (llm-automation-agent).\nFor your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.\nHere is the GitHub link to my project:\n\n\ngithub.com\n\n\n\n\nGitHub - ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent\nContribute to ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent development by creating an account on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage1440\u00d72823 252 KB\nLookig forward towards your support.\nWith Regards\nK Senthur Kumaran",

However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn\u2019t explicitly install Node.js or npx, this results in an error during evaluation.\nTo test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:\nbash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm\nOnce installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected.\nFor reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.",

    "content": "Dear Sirs,\n@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton\nAs per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.\nScreenshot 2025-04-07 233513805\u00d7197 9.52 KB\nGithub repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent\nDocker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent\nThe previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.\nI would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:\nhttps://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py.\nBut as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent.\nHumbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.\nI\u2019m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.\nThank You and Regards,\n24ds3000090",

    "content": "@carlton @Jivraj\nSir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.\nimage1298\u00d7857 29.4 KB\nI actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn\u2019t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.\nEdit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/\u2026\nBut my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.\nEdit 2:\nEven if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.\nimage1027\u00d7510 11 KB\nThough an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nShivaditya",

The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,\nNow after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..\nIt would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.",

    "content": "@carlton @Jivraj\nRespected Sir,\nI hope you are doing well.\nThis is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term\nI would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase \u2018d\u2019) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase \u2018D\u2019).\nWhile the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.\nI humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.\nSo, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.\nThank you very much for your time and consideration.\nWarm regards,\nS. Sharmile\nRoll No: 23f3001688",
