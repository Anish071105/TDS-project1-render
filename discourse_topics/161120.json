So you have to do very minimal modifications to it and it works like a charm.\nKind regards",

    "content": "@23F300327 You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine.\nGA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems.\nNow typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly.\nAlso the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing.\nThere will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z\u21922025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.\nThe session is in your course calendar and the meet link is meet.google.com/baz-ayij-ziy\nKind regards",

    "content": "@23F300327\nTypically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code.\nWhen a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api\nwith parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request.\nThe rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel\u2019s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program.\nThat\u2019s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this\n# api/index.py\nimport json\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler\n\nclass handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type','application/json')\n        self.send_header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\")\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(json.dumps({\"message\": \"Hello!\"}).encode('utf-8'))\n        return\n\nNotice there is no if __name__ == \"__main__\": code block.\nThis would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application.\nif __name__ == \"__main__\": is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application.\nTry rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared.\nAnother possible problem:\nBy default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the \\u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised  UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode\nSo converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it.\nLet us know what worked. We are all learning from each other.\nKind regards",

Also check the recording from yesterday\u2019s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you\u2019re still facing issues, you can join today\u2019s session at 9 PM.\nFor deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community.

    "content": "@23f1002382\nNothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat.\nThat being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a \u201cscientist\u201d, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the \u201cspirit of your question\u201d.\nMost of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials!\nSo we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done.\nIn the meanwhile:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Hi Srividya,\nThats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints.\nWhen the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs.\nThis renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it).\nIn other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2.\nThis is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications.\nThanks for your input.\nKind regards",

When I revisited the GA2 again, the question 10 was marked incorrect.\nDo I need to do anything else ?\nSecondly the image comression file needs to be reloaded everytime I reconnect to the GA2. When I reload the last saved version, it does not take into the answer already saved.\nThird, the url link as given on publishing the page via github is obviously correct. But on checking, even after ?v = 1 \u2026it does not work. Could you kindly look into them and advise if anything else needs to be done at my end? thanks & regards.",
