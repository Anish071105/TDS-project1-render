    "content": "@Saransh_Saini\nQ5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.\nNow we are struggling with Q8.\nMY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.\nwhen i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error: At root: Array length mismatch\nReason:  below query checking only 1st comment ($[0] refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.\nBut when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.\nWITH filtered_posts AS (\n  SELECT post_id\n  FROM social_media\n  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'\n    AND EXISTS (\n      SELECT 1\n      FROM social_media AS sm\n      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL\n        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4\n    )\n)\nSELECT post_id\nFROM filtered_posts\nORDER BY post_id ASC;\n\nKindly check if any issue with Q8.\nMay be my query is wrong or may be not.\nThankyou",

    "content": "@lakshaygarg654\nYour query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.\nQuery construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.\nIn this case its an ordered post_id\nSo thats where you begin:\nSELECT post_id\nFROM (\n...\n)\nORDER BY post_id\n\nDoing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.\nThen at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.\nYou will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query.\n...\n...\nFROM (\n   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars\n   FROM social_media\n   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)\n      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)\n)\n...\n...\n\nThen the final layer of the nest\n...\n...\n(\n\n) as max_stars\n...\n...\n\nYou are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or \u201cstructure\u201d extraction, which is a powerful capability)\nBut I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.\nThink clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.\nKind regards",

    "content": "Thank you for your response @carlton. You are absolutely right\u2014my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:\n\njson_extract: \u201cTable Function with name \u2018json_extract\u2019 is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.\u201d\njson_each: \u201cTable Function with name \u2018json_each\u2019 is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.\u201d\njson_extract_path_text: \u201cTable Function with name \u2018json_extract_path_text\u2019 is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.\u201d\n\nSince the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.\nI would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8.\nThankyou",

    "content": "QUESTION 9\nI was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",
