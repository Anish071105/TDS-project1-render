    "content": "@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nDear Sir,\nI have few questions. It is written in the Tools in Data Science that we can expose the api using vercel (the example given also uses vercel). But I don\u2019t think vercel can handle/allow many operations, some of them are listed below.\n\nIn GA 1 ques 13 and  GA 2 Ques 7, we have to create github repo, then creating github actions and then retrieve the raw github file url. We can accomplish this using Github CLI gh  which we have to install in the vercel instance using apt package manager.\nBut, Vercel does not provide sudo access which is required to install packages.\nIn GA 2 ques 10, we have to use local LLM (Llamafile), will vercel allow that?\nAlso after that, we have to give answer as the ngrok public url for which we have to first install ngrok package.\nIn GA 2 ques 8,  uploading an image to Dockerhub requires docker package installed.\nIn GA 2 ques 6, Deploy a Python API to Vercel in a Vercel instance?\nMany ques require writing and running FastAPI server to serve data with CORS enabled. Can Vercel allow/do that?\nAnd many more\n\nMost tasks mentioned above like installing packages etc. requires sudo privilages or may face restrictions set by Vercel.\nVercel does not provide sudo access or any form of root access to its hosting environment which is required to perform the above tasks.\nMany of these task can be done in our local systems (exposing to internet using cloudflare tunnels/ngrok), but we cannot run our systems 24*7 during evaluation.\nI can see only one option left that is renting a VPS from server providers like digitalocean, gcp, aws etc, which will provide us sudo access and 100% uptime.\nAlso, some ques requires external toolings like\n\nIn GA1 ques 5, it is written to explicitly use Excel and this will only work in Office 365.\nIn GA1 ques 6, we have to use Devtools to show/find the hidden element in the question. Now, the question parameter in the POST request will be plain text, so how the element can hide there?\nGA 2 ques 4 and GA 2 ques 5 uses Google Colab specific python libraries like google.colab which can\u2019t be installed locally.\n\nHow to solve these above questions that require explicit usage of external tools.\nAlso, handling POST request for some questions are not clear like\n\nIn GA 2 ques 2, we have to compress the image and upload the image as answer. So, now how to response such answer in json object. Should we encode the resultant compressed image as base64 string or Image URL or  Data URI.\nSome ques have images in them. For those images in GAs, I right clicked and used \u201cSave as\u201d to save the images and then done the required computations. So, now when this question will be sent as POST request, will the image be included as the base64 encoded string in the question parameter of the POST request itself or as an optional file attachment?\n\nAnother concern is regarding the OpenAI API TOKEN, unlike Project 1, Project 2 does not have an API_TOKEN parameter in the POST request. Hence, the API TOKEN provided from https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev will be also used during evaluation. Now, what will happen if our API TOKEN credits gets end during evaluation. The LLM will throw errors then.\nPlease advise what we should do. please clarify Sir.",

    "content": "Hello Sir,\nI have a few questions. Would like your thoughts and suggestions over the same.\n\n\nCurrently answers that we have entered for GA\u2019s 1 to 4 are not available and only for GA5 its available. It would be helpful for the project (when running the Curl command for each of the question) if the assignments can display the answers we\u2019ve entered as well for verification purposes.\n\n\nThe first question of GA1 q1 needs for us to run vs code but when executing it through vercel its not possible because vercel is a serverless environment. In this case, is it okay to manually enter the answer in the code, so when the question is triggered it takes the manual output from the code.\n\n\nCan you provide some clarity as to how the question is supposed to be and structured ? Or should the code be able to handle multiple variants of the question? To address this concern, i tried to implement sentence_transformers using a lightweight model but the vercel application build failed saying that the data is too long and that Vercel serverless function deployment size exceeds the limit of 250 MB. Should i consider deploying elsewhere or change the approach?\n\n\nHow do we handle questions pertaining to Devtools - creating input box etc.\n\n\nThanks and Regards\nShalini",

    "content": "I just want to know if you prefer using an existing language model application where we utilize an LLM (Large Language Model), train it, and format the output. For instance, I used the Gemini API key, integrated it with Python, and then formatted the results with the help of Copilot to achieve the desired outputs.\nAlternatively, do you want us to create a new LLM model and train it with questions from graded assignments? I\u2019m curious about your preference.\nAdditionally, would you like the LLM to provide specific answers regarding computer specifications, or should it give general specifications? For example, in Graded Assignment 1, there is a question about the editor: Visual Studio Code.\nYour editor is the most important tool in your arsenal; that\u2019s where you\u2019ll spend most of your time, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable with it.\nVisual Studio Code is, by far, the most popular code editor today. According to the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey, almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you\u2019ll likely work with others who use VS Code, so having some exposure is beneficial.\nTo get started, you can watch these introductory videos (totaling 35 minutes) from the Visual Studio Docs:\n\nGetting Started: Set up and learn the basics of Visual Studio Code (7 min)\nCode Editing: Learn how to edit and run code in VS Code (3 min)\nProductivity Tips: Become a VS Code power user with these productivity tips (4 min)\nPersonalize: Personalize VS Code to make it yours with themes (2 min)\nExtensions: Add features, themes, and more to VS Code with extensions (4 min)\nDebugging: Get started with debugging in VS Code (6 min)\nVersion Control: Learn how to use Git version control in VS Code (3 min)\nCustomize: Learn how to customize your settings and keyboard shortcuts in VS Code (6 min)\n\nAI Editors: Copilot, Cursor\nNote: AI editors like Cursor, Cody, and GitHub Copilot use LLMs to help you write code faster. These tools are built on top of VS Code and have become standard in every developer\u2019s toolkit. Please make sure to use them.\nTo install and run Visual Studio Code, open your Terminal (or Command Prompt) and type code -s, then press Enter. Copy and paste the entire output below.\nWhat is the output of code -s? The output of code -s cannot be universally answered because it depends on the user\u2019s system and the specific version of VS Code installed. The question requests the output of a command that is unique to each user.\nAs for the part about getting answers from the LLM model, I believe that may require using an AI agent. I am currently searching for a solution for this, and I would like to know your thoughts on it.\nimage1214\u00d7831 34.8 KB",

Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer.\nGive the answer back as specified.\n\nKind regards",

But I don\u2019t clearly get one thing.\nMost of the questions have a question text and a file: csv,zip,json,etc\nMy doubt is, will the request to the end point be :\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F \"question=question text\" \\\n  -F \"file=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/stats/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;template=results;type=batting\"\n\n\nmy doubt :\nIs this the only format or can there be other too ?\n",

    "content": "Fine sir, this is clear. I have a few doubts in the file formats. When free, kindly address these to. I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn\u2019t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly.\nFILES\nThe data file sent to the api will always be in the requester\u2019s local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format?\nOr\nSometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this :  https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png\nThis link was take from GA2 Question 2\nHTML AND TABLE\nSome questions have html and tables. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string.\nExample for string. Consider the table\n\n\n\n\nCol 1\nCol 2\n\n\n\n\nRow 1, Col1\nRow 1 Col 2\n\n\nRow 2, Col 1\nRow 2 Col 2\n\n\n\nWill this be something like this\n\"|Col 1| Col 2|\\n|-|-|\\n|Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2|\\n|Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2|\"\n\nor something like\n\"<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Col 1</th>\\n<th>Col 2</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 1, Col1</td>\\n<td>Row 1 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Row 2, Col 1</td>\\n<td>Row 2 Col 2</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\n\"\n\nHIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS\nIn one question, there were two tasks.\n\nFind the answer to the question\nEnable the disabled text block\n\nIn this question, what will the answer type be?\nShould it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block\nMORE THAN ONE FILE\nSome questions have more than one file. For example, the last question of GA5, it has a png file in this link https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/jigsaw.webp and a table.\nIn this case, how will the curl request be? Is it some thing like this\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F \"question=question text\" \\\n  -F \"file= Image file\" \\\n  -F \"file= table file/ string\" \n\nCORS HEADERS\nWill the CORS headers asked in the question be the same or can it be different?",

Here, the image is take from some url. For example. in GA2, q2, the image displayed is taken from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png.\nMy doubt is, what will be the value of file attribute in curl command\nWill it be\n\n\u201cfile=binary of zipfile/csv/json\u201d for the first type and\n\u201cfile=https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png\u201d for the second type\n\n\n\n\n Jivraj:\n\nThis is correct html table format.\n\n\nWill this table be in the \u201cquestion\u201d attribute of curl or \u201cfile\u201d attribute\n\n\n\n Jivraj:\n\nIn last question of GA5 there is only one file(image), table is not coming through file, it will be kept same for project2.\n\n\nso, can I assume that the table will be given as a html element in the \u201cquestion\u201d attribute and the image in the \u201cfile\u201d attribute?",

    "content": "@carlton and @jivraj,\nHello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn\u2019t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying..\nI have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don\u2019t have those answers). Thank you.",

However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I\u2019m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1\u2014one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.\nmydata939\u00d7401 18.3 KB\nfriend data938\u00d7465 20.5 KB\nDuring the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.\n\n\nIn GA4 Q2, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages\u2014Spanish, Dutch, I believe.\nimage1674\u00d7420 24.3 KB\nimage1118\u00d7358 63.7 KB\nPlease check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question.\n\n\nIn GA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.\nHere is the thread link for reference.\nHow should we handle this question now?\n\n\nThankyou",

However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I\u2019m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1\u2014one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate.\nmydata939\u00d7401 18.3 KB\nfriend data938\u00d7465 20.5 KB\nDuring the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed.\n\n\nThe file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of.\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nIn GA4 Q2, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages\u2014Spanish, Dutch, I believe.\n\n\nQuestions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal.\n\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\nIn GA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, @carlton sir had mentioned that the question would be revised.\nHere is the thread link for reference.\nHow should we handle this question now?\n\n\nSame as above.\nKind regards",

    "content": "@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini\nQuestions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday\u2019s Session)\nRespected TDS Team,\nAs per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following @Saransh\u2019s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation.\n\n Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue\n\n\nGA3 Q8\n\nIssue: The question doesn\u2019t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag.\n\n\n\nGA3 Q9\n\nIssue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN.\nClarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation?\n\n\n\nGA4 Q2 & Q10\n\nIssue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved.\nReference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution\n\n\n\nOutput Formatting (Multiple Questions)\n\nIssue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters (\\n) and backslashes are added.\nNote: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {\u201canswer\u201d: \u201cresult\u201d}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal.\n\n\n\nVercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions\n\nIssue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok.\nClarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated?\n\n\n\n\nDeployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday\u2019s Session)\nPlease include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues:\n\n\nPlatform Capability for GA Tasks\n\nWhich cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably?\nNote: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage.\n\n\n\nFile Upload Example via Platform API\n\nRequest: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app.\nThis would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input.\n\n\n\nGeneral Observations on GA1-5\nOutput Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems.\n\n\n\nKindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals.\nAll the best for your OPPE and your Project 2 ",

Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file.\nPlease review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters.\nThe browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists.\nThe programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually)\nTo check if a string has invisible characters,\n# Multi-line string\nmy_string = \"\"\"Hello\nWorld    with    spaces \nand some newlines\nand a tab\t\"\"\"\n\n# Print ASCII values of each character\nprint([ord(c) for c in my_string])\n\ne.g., newline = 10, tab = 9\nThis is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response,\nimport requests\nimport json\n\n# This is just an example server to see what we see.\n\nurl = \"https://httpbin.org/post\"\n\nmy_multiline_string_answer = \"\"\"This is a multiline\nstring that spans\nmultiple lines    with    spaces \nand some newlines\nand a tab\tas well.\"\"\"\n\nresponse_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {\n\"answer\": my_multiline_string_answer\n}\n\n# Send the JSON data\nresponse = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)\n\n# Check the response\nprint (response.status_code)\nprint (response.json ())\nprint (response.text)\n\n# Do other checks as necessary... \n\nSee what happens when I print the result\nprint (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])\n\nScreenshot 2025-03-27 at 1.09.56 pm323\u00d7120 3.61 KB\nIts a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA.\nHere is a json example:\njson_answer = {\n    \"mary\": \"poppins\",\n    \"age\": 42\n}\n\nstringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer)\nresponse_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = {\n\"answer\": stringed_json\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator)\n\nprint (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer'])\n\nLook at the response.

    "content": "@carlton , @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\n\nGA2 - Question 3: Publish a Page Using GitHub Pages\n\n\n\nAs part of the requirement, I successfully published a webpage using GitHub Pages that includes my email address 21f3001076@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in the HTML content. The page functions correctly and becomes accessible on my local system.\n\n\nTo automate the publishing process, I implemented a delay function that checks for the page\u2019s availability after 5 seconds. Based on testing, GitHub Pages typically take around 10\u201320 seconds to go live after repository creation and HTML deployment. As a result, the complete process\u2014from initiating the API call to verifying that the page is live\u2014takes approximately 30 seconds locally. This setup works reliably on my local machine.\n\n\nHowever, when deploying the same process on Azure, I encountered an issue. Without the delay, the API responds too quickly\u2014before the GitHub Pages site is actually live\u2014resulting in a broken or non-functional link on the assignment portal. On the other hand, including the delay function causes Azure to throw a 502 Bad Gateway error, likely due to Azure\u2019s request timeout limitations. The additional wait time slightly exceeds the platform\u2019s allowed response duration.\n\n\n\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\n\n\n\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure\u2019s execution time limit.\n\n\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\n\nCurrently, I am using Azure for deployment, and for the majority of tasks, it works reliably. Although these specific tasks face timeout issues, shifting to another deployment platform is not feasible at this point. I am not certain if alternative platforms will work consistently across all questions, and making such a change could introduce failures in other parts of the assignment where Azure performs well.\nBelow Image is showing response of local machine api request for GA2 Q3 which works fine.\nimage1854\u00d7493 55.9 KB",

    "content": "@s.anand\n@carlton\n@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nFinal Thoughts on Project 2\nProject 2 has been a valuable yet challenging experience. I\u2019d like to share a few reflections\u2014not as criticism, but as constructive feedback with the intention to contribute positively to future iterations.\n\nOrganization & Structure:\nThe project felt a bit unstructured at times, which may be expected given that this is possibly the first time such an initiative is being carried out. I\u2019m not blaming anyone\u2014just sharing my thoughts. I hope positive insights can be drawn from this feedback.\nDeployment & Portal Limitations:\nThere are noticeable limitations on the deployment side (e.g., timeouts, platform constraints) and occasional issues on the assignment portal. While frustrating, these also led to some deep technical learning.\nTime Constraints:\nBalancing this project with ongoing coursework and other responsibilities has been quite demanding. The deadline of March 31st adds pressure, making it difficult to thoroughly test all 57 questions across different environments.\nSessions & Support:\nThe sessions conducted were helpful in addressing specific topics, but in many areas, I had to rely heavily on GPT and self-guided exploration to move forward.\nDeployment Variability:\nEach GA\u2019s questions seemed to expose different limitations depending on the deployment platform. This inconsistency made it hard to predict which questions would work reliably.\nEffort Acknowledgment:\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TAs and instructors\u2014it\u2019s clear that a lot of hard work went into enabling and supporting this project. However, it\u2019s also a bit disappointing that we, as students, are unsure which questions are expected to work and which may fail\u2014even the team might not have full visibility over this at the moment.\nFeasibility in the Given Timeline:\nEven for someone with a technical background, it\u2019s difficult to troubleshoot and experiment across so many cases within the current timeline. Trying different approaches per question isn\u2019t always feasible before the deadline.\n\n\nI genuinely hope someone is able to complete all 57 questions successfully\u2014I\u2019d love to learn from their experience and solutions.\nAgain, this post is meant in a positive and constructive spirit. If anything I said seems inappropriate or off the mark, please let me know\u2014I\u2019m happy to edit or delete the post if needed.\nThank you for the learning opportunity",

    "content": "WhatsApp Image 2025-03-27 at 13.41.43_5bd0a1821600\u00d71069 246 KB\nDear Sirs,\nI have a question regarding Q3 and Q4 of GA5. When calling the API, should we pass the .gz file directly, or will the API accept a Google Drive link from which it can download the .gz file?\nSpecifically, will the API call be structured as follows?\nEssentialy, will the API call look like so?\n\ncurl -X POST \u201chttp://127.0.0.1:5000\u201d \n-H \u201cContent-Type: multipart/form-data\u201d \n-F \"question=Bandwidth Analysis for Regional Contents - anand.net is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site\u2019s key sections is tamilmp3, which hosts music files and is especially popular among the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server load, and content engagement. By analyzing the server\u2019s Apache log file, the author can identify heavy users and take measures to manage bandwidth, improve site performance, or even investigate potential abuse. Your Task: This GZipped Apache log file has 258,074 rows. Each row is an Apache web log entry for the site s-anand.net in May 2024. Each row has these fields:\nIP: The IP address of the visitor.\nRemote logname: The remote logname of the visitor. Typically \u2018-\u2019.\nRemote user: The remote user of the visitor. Typically \u2018-\u2019.\nTime: The time of the visit. E.g. [01/May/2024:00:00:00 +0000]. Note that this is not quoted, and you need to handle this.\nRequest: The request made by the visitor. E.g. GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1. It has three space-separated parts:\n(a) Method: The HTTP method. E.g. GET.\n(b) URL: The URL visited. E.g. /blog/.\n(c) Protocol: The HTTP protocol. E.g. HTTP/1.1.\nStatus: The HTTP status code. If 200 <= Status < 300, it is a successful request.\nSize: The size of the response in bytes. E.g. 1234.\nReferer: The referer URL. E.g. https://s-anand.net/.\nUser agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.\nVhost: The virtual host. E.g. s-anand.net.\nServer: The IP address of the server.\nThe fields are separated by spaces and quoted by double quotes (\u2018-\u2019). Unlike CSV files, quoted fields are escaped via \\\" and not \u2018-\u2019. (This impacts 41 rows.)\nAll data is in the GMT-0500 timezone, and the questions are based on this same timezone.\nFilter the Log Entries: Extract only the requests where the URL starts with /tamilmp3/. Include only those requests made on the specified 2024-05-23.\nAggregate Data by IP: Sum the \u2018Size\u2019 field for each unique IP address from the filtered entries.\nIdentify the Top Data Consumer: Determine the IP address that has the highest total downloaded bytes. Report the total number of bytes that this IP address downloaded.\nAcross all requests under tamilmp3/ on 2024-05-23, how many bytes did the top IP address (by volume of downloads) download?\" \n-F \u201cfile=@s-anand.net-May-2024.gz\u201d\n\nI would appreciate your clarification on whether the .gz file should be directly included in the API request or if a Google Drive link should be provided instead.\nThank you for your time and assistance.",

    "content": "\n\n\n lakshaygarg654:\n\n\nGA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files\n\n\nA similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure\u2019s execution time limit.\nMoreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem.\n\n\n\n@carlton\nI watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint.\nHow should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn\u2019t help.\n@s.anand\n@carlton @Jivraj\nAlso, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE.\nIt would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline.\nI believe it would strike a good balance\u2014team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.",

Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request.\nUnfortunately, we can\u2019t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it. If you are lagging far behind in the race, we would encourage you to collaborate with other and get the project done.",

    "content": "Hello Sir,\nI want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project. I have developed a mini chatbot backend using vicky_server.py, which handles question matching and execution internally, producing appropriate responses. My mini chatbot is capable of creating its own API using REST and can manage tasks such as image compression, repository management, workflows, and web scraping related to graded assignments. It can even calculate total marks for subjects like physics and convert PDFs into markdown content. Additionally, it is capable of downloading the Llama model and creating a tunnel using ngrok. Essentially, it can address the first four assignment questions.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this project. Currently, it processes my local files instead of the uploaded PDFs. I am working on resolving this issue, but I have some confusion regarding the internal handling of uploaded files. When I pass a PDF or file through an upload method, how should the system proceed? I want to ensure that the file is treated as a PDF for the user rather than just being referenced as \u201cquestion.pdf.\u201d How can I effectively manage this problem?\nFurthermore, there is an issue with question matching. At times, the system incorrectly identifies questions containing the word \u201ccode\u201d and executes first.py for GA1.\nThank you for the opportunity to work on this project!\nBest regards,\nvicky kumar\n@s.anand @carlton @Saransh_Saini\nmy model at Vicky kumar tds",

So I can just have a repo with my email in it, right?\nGA2:\nQ2 - Compress an image: Should my app\u2019s response be like this\n{\n     \"answer\": \"base64_encoding_of_compressed_image\"\n}\n\nQ3 - Host your portfolio on GitHub Pages, Q7 - Create a GitHub action, Q8 - Push an Image to Docker Hub: Similar to GA1 Q13, these too have my email or roll number as parameter. These too WILL NOT be checked against any other email, right?\nGA3:\nCan you please give an example of how questions of this GA will be sent in the request, especially any of Q1 or Q2 or Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 which have code-blocks containing text crucial to the question? I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate here.\nGA4:\nThe links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

Specifically:\n\nMake sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key.\nUse gpt-4o-mini as the model.\nThe first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories.\nThe second message must be exactly the text contained above.\n\nThis test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications.\nNote: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one.

I request the timeout to be at least 40-60 seconds as yt-dlp and faster-whisper take take to download the audio, load the model and run it on cpu and get the transcription.\nFor 259.7 to 351.8 seconds, it is taking around 1.5 mins, but it is giving the correct answer.\nSo I request you to shorten the length of the audio or increase the request timeout or both in moderation.\nQuestion \u2014> the \u201cquestion\u201d sent to the api will have the youtube video link, right? Or since the video is same for everyone, can I just have the audio file ready in the project? Will the api be tested against any YouTube video other than the Mystery Story Audiobook link given in the GA question?\nEdit: Even with a preprocessed audio file (mp3, speech optimized, 32K), what\u2019s taking the longest time is joining the transcribed sentences into a single string. That alone is taking >50 seconds. Please suggest a way to make it faster.\nRegards,\nShivaditya",

    "content": "I reuesting to all my teachers @s.anand, @carlton, @Jivraj, @Saransh_Saini please reply me.\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don\u2019t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn\u2019t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don\u2019t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber\u2019s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything.\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \". I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don\u2019t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI\u2019s or read whatever and wherever you want to read.\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019.",

    "content": "Dear Shahzada,\nYou joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post)\nThe first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nWhat is this going on? Is it joking?\n\n\nI am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nOur teachers don\u2019t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do?\n\n\nWe have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nI already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project.\n\n\nNot sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared)\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThey explained what should be your approach? How to make project?\n\n\nYes these were explained if you\n\neither took part in any live session or\nwatched the recorded video\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nAnd here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times?\n\n\nI am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nIt is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off.\n\n\nProject 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words:\nCreate a server api that receives a request.\nThe request would be any question from the first 5 GAs.\nThe response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page.\nMultiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nEven they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake?\n\n\nSince this is your first post, you\u2019ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process.\nIf you want solutions, there are several options:\n\nAsk for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it)\nCollaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration)\nJoin live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked)\nWatch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment)\n\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThey don\u2019t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically.\n\n\nThis is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting.\nThe biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs\u2026 with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nAre we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India\u2019s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers.\n\n\nIf you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video.\nBut feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up.\nWhat are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that.\nI absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThey only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don\u2019t ask anything.\n\n\nReading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked.  Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world.\nNow is a good time to start.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nSome students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- \"We won\u2019t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. \"\n\n\nThat is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nI want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1?\n\n\nThey have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time.\nLuckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be).\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nThe first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers.\n\n\nIf you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nIn project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal.\n\n\nAnand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution?\nAlso if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month  etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script.\nBut validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime.\nYou can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback.\n\n\n\n 23f2002668:\n\nIt is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term.\nThankyou to all my respected \u2018The Great Teachers\u2019.\n\n\nI am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post.\nBut thank you for your feedback.\nOne final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score.\nAnd when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve.\nKind regards,\nTDS team",

    "content": "Hi, I have a few things to say\nMy background :\nI have completed all the courses in diploma except TDS. I have secured reasonably good grades in all the courses. However, I failed TDS the last term and I am likely to fail in this term too. The reason is, I got bad marks in both ROE and I have never submitted any project, i.e., I have not submitted 3 TDS projects in the last two terms and did badly in the first project of the previous term.\nMy Initial Disappointments with this Course\nIn one of the orientation session, I heard Andrew sir say this (subject to correction):\n\nThe video lectures are the primary content. It is not compulsory to attend the live sessions, but it is highly recommended.\n\n\nHere, the most important resource are the live sessions. I did not like it. Till now, I have managed all the courses with faculty lectures alone. I rarely watch live sessions. I didn\u2019t like watching live sessions. I felt it was against what is pointed out in the previous paragraph\nROE is just for forty five minutes, with around 10 questions. I felt that this is rubbish and unthoughtful.\nThere are not many videos explaining the tools (from IIT side). Only a few videos. Most of the tools are explained through text. I felt that a the purpose of a college course is to explain things in a simple way so that we can learn it easily.\n\nWhy did I fail?\nLast Term\nI dumped myself with a 3 more courses, projects and nptel courses. I didn\u2019t practice the GAs properly. So I failed ROE. I will come to the projects soon.\nThis term.\nI made sure that I do all the GAs properly. But I did better than last time in ROE but still bad. This time because, other than GAs, I didn\u2019t allocate time for ROE. Also, I didn\u2019t submit both the projects.\nIn both the terms I didn\u2019t collaborate with anyone. I felt that I shouldn\u2019t earn my marks be talking help from someone. I felt it is not fair.\nMe Understanding about the Course Now\nThis one line changed my view about ROE.\n\n\n\nOn another topic\n\nWhat does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning.\n\n\nI am reasonably ok with python and all the tools in this course. But in ROE, I was not able to write a nested for loop, which was needed for some question. It is not that I don\u2019t know how to write a simple nested loop. I discovered the fact that I have not coded enough.\nI scored 100 in all the OPPEs : python, java, PDSA, DBMS. I knew the concepts. But the questions were not difficult and the time was ample. This is not the case in TDS.\nNow I realize that  I am not good in SQL or DSA. It is just the questions were easy and was accompanied with ample time.\nIn MLP, I score just 40 in OPPE 1, this was because of me not practicing SKLearn. Then I practiced and got 90 in the second OPPE.\nThis course has made me realise that till I need to learn relearn these things in an implicit way.\nThis is the exact reason why I have not been able to complete the projects. I still know most of the things required for project 1 and 2. But I was not able to practically sit and write the code.\nI have understood that this is not a traditional course. I feel that we must expect something different from this course. Especially not just marks\nI have understood that the limited amount of recorded lectures for is a way to make the students to practically go through the documentation. Understand the complex phrasing of some functionalities, etc.\nI am most likely to take this course again. I feel extremely bad to have wasted 15000 rupees. But this course has been a wake up call for me. I still feel that I have the potential to do this course way better than this. What I would have to do is a lot more coding of what I have already learnt.\nFrom the other project courses, I had a wrong assumption that projects are about applying what we have learnt. This was also a reason why I didn\u2019t do my projects in TDS. I felt that the course team didn\u2019t cover all the essentials of a projects. I have now realized that projects are about applying what we know and also learn new things which will enhance our projects.\nSince this is not a traditional course, I also feel that it is fine to collaborate and seek help, at the same time, strive to contribute to others too.\nThanks to @s.anand , @carlton , @Jivraj  and @Saransh_Saini\n\nJust two suggestions\n\n\nI feel that MAD 2 and MLP should be corequisites.\nWhile introducing the projects, kindly include a video where the flow of the project is explained. Also, address few questions in the video itself which are likely to be asked by us.\n",

Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel\u2019s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project\u2019s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash.\nCould you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.",

    "content": ":\n\n From Problem to Platform: Building \u201cVicky\u201d \u2013 A Smart Data Science Assistant for TDS @ IIT Madras\n Project Demo Website: https://app.algsoch.tech\nDuring our college course Tool for Data Science (TDS) at IIT Madras, we were tasked with a challenging but exciting project: to build a platform that can take in natural language questions and execute corresponding solutions through an API.\n The Mission:\nCreate a tool that behaves like a chatbot, accepts user queries (text or file-based) via web or API, processes them intelligently, executes the appropriate code, and returns accurate results\u2014like a real data science assistant.\n\n The Journey: From Fails to Final\nAt first, the natural choice was to try LLM agents\u2014they sounded magical. But in real-world usage, they were slow, unreliable, and lacked precision. Most failed to parse or execute even moderately dynamic queries. \nThen I thought\u2014what if I manually mapped questions and answers using a static JSON structure? That quickly broke when users passed different parameters, different files, or queried in non-standard formats like \u201ccode -s\u201d or \u201ccode -v\u201d.\nThe next idea: write individual Python scripts per question from our Graded Assignments (GA1\u2013GA5). But that lacked flexibility and reusability. Creating multiple files became unmanageable and non-scalable. \n\n The Breakthrough: Dynamic Function Mapping\nAfter multiple iterations and failed prototypes, I finally found the right architecture:\n Centralized engine in vicky_server.py\n Uses regex-based pattern matching to detect question types, extract parameters, and identify the correct solution\n Each solution is a structured Python function like ga1_first_solution(query=None)\n Supports dynamic parameter injection, command-line variations, file-based queries, and more\n Acts like a mini compiler for data science tools\n\n Presenting Vicky \u2013 The Mini Chatbot for TDS \nVicky is a smart, modular chatbot built specifically for Tool for Data Science at IIT Madras. It\u2019s packed with real functionality\u2014not just templates.\nKey Features:\n Graded Assignment Solver\nHandles dynamic, real-world questions from GA1 to GA5 like:\n\ncode -s / code -v \u2192 VS terminal commands\nCreate FastAPI API for CSV with filtering/searching\nGitHub automation: repo creation, GitHub Actions setup\nData cleaning, scraping from IMDb, image compression\n\n File Upload with Query Matching\nUsers can upload a file (CSV, JSON, Excel) and ask file-specific queries. The system understands context and dynamically links the query to the uploaded file.\n HTML Viewer + Base64 Decoder\n\nView any website in rendered & source format using CORS proxy\nUpload Base64 string \u2192 Get original image back\n\n Webhooks Integration\n\nLive notifications via Discord & Slack whenever /api endpoints are accessed\nMonitors server status (online/offline) and sends real-time updates\n\n LLM Download + Auto Tunneling\n\nDownloads LLaMA models\nDynamically finds available ports\nCreates and exposes tunneled endpoints\n\n Live Web UI at app.algsoch.tech\n\nAsk any TDS question\nUpload and query with files\nImage decoder\nGraded assignment slider navigation\nHTML viewer\nAPI health status\n\n\n Built With:\n\nFastAPI for blazing fast APIs\nRegex & Pattern Matching for dynamic input detection\nGitHub Copilot + my Python debugging and architectural thinking\nFull webhook and status monitoring system\nModular backend (vicky_server.py) and web frontend (vicky_app.py)\n\nI want to extend a huge thank you to @s.anand for their guidance on this project. I\u2019ve learned what prompt engineering is and how we can leverage large language models (LLMs). One interesting takeaway is that while these technologies won\u2019t replace our jobs\u2014especially for those who understand programming\u2014they will create new job opportunities instead.\nNow I am capable of how fastapi work and more things and how to structure code and how to design code and most important what to think for project",

I then found an alternative solution using Cloudflare with a custom domain that I obtained through the GitHub Student Pack. I successfully created a tunnel, and it is currently functional. I can shut down my laptop, and it still works with the same URL when I restart.\nI hope you will consider my case. I submitted my work at that time because I learned about this solution from a fellow student on Discord. I only changed the URL and made no other modifications.\nThank you for your understanding",

During the last Google Meet session, we explained the situation to @Saransh_Saini.\nIt seems that when we edit our responses, the timestamp with other values updates not submitted as new response. However, the position of the response in the form remains unchanged. For instance, we submitted our response at 11:30 PM on March 31st, and someone else submitted theirs at 11:45 PM. Even after editing our response the next day, our entry still appears above theirs.\nWe just wanted to clarify: Will responses edited or submitted on April 1st still be considered, given that the form remains open? If not, is there any way we can show proof of our original submission? Currently, we have email confirmations for both the initial and the edited responses.\nWe hope this won\u2019t be a major issue, especially not on the level of Project 1 concerns. Looking forward to a positive resolution from the TDS team.\nThank you\nLakshay",

Now what exactly have I edited is just added a \u201c/\u201d at the end and that\u2019s it and nothing more. Highlighting it again, I haven\u2019t resubmitted the form but edited it on the very next morning after the deadline.\nSo now my question is: My edited response will be accepted right in this case?\nSir, please throw some light on my doubt.\nWarm Regards,\nTensed TDS Student",

I mentioned the exactly correct URL of my app in the form but the evaluation logs show three different types of URL to which request was made. As I mentioned in the form, my url is of the format \u201chttps://\u2026/api/\u201d and allows only POST requests.\n\nThe app was supposed to allow POST requests and I allowed only POST requests, so GET requests even to correct url resulted in 405 response\nWhen POST requests were actually made, two wrong urls were used for all the POST requests\na. http://\u2026/api/ \u2192 resulted in 302 response\nb. https://\u2026/api  \u2192 resulted in a 307\nwhereas the url I gave was of the format \u201chttps://\u2026/api/\u201d\n\nThe logs from Cloud Run\nimage982\u00d7552 133 KB\nAs you can see from the above logs, all POST requests made to my app have the wrong url, some have only http and some end with \u201c/api\u201d instead of \u201c/api/\u201d, both of which do not match with the correct url I gave in the Google Form (screenshot attached below).\nimage831\u00d7645 41.7 KB\nI request you to re-evaluate my project 2 with the correct url exactly as I had submitted in the Google Form.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nShivaditya",

And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable.\nThis is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)",

    "content": "@carlton,@Saransh_Saini\nsir my roll number is 23f2004462\nDue to an unexpected power outage, my PC shut down abruptly, causing my local server and ngrok tunnel to terminate. When the system rebooted, I restarted the server and ngrok, which generated a new API endpoint as ngrok URLs are temporary and change with every session. The previous endpoint is no longer accessible, and the new one now serves as the API endpoint. I understand the need for a consistent URL and will explore solutions like reserving a domain through ngrok\u2019s paid plan to prevent such issues in the future. Apologies for any inconvenience caused, and thank you for understanding.\nNew project 2 url:- https://96c8-2401-4900-6290-6a14-b433-2faa-a056-a6e5.ngrok-free.app/api/",

They were 200 OK requests on /api/ and 4 requests  were 307 redirect on /api. I presume they were from TDS team. Next day got email to shut off endpoint. I had tested endpoint locally and on ngrok. Both were fine. Was the updated endpoint in the google form evaluated? Was there some problem with the updated endpoint?",

As I had previously mentioned, the Render deployment link I submitted may take approximately 50 to 60 seconds to activate upon the first load. This behavior is typical of free-tier deployments on Render, and I assure you that the application functions correctly in both Podman and Linux environments.\nUpon reviewing my Render logs, I could not find any indication that the project was accessed or evaluated during the expected activation time. To ensure smooth accessibility, I have also deployed the same GitHub repository on Railway and submitted that link as well.\nIf possible, I kindly request either of the following:\n\nRe-evaluation using the Railway link I provided, or\nRe-evaluation using the Render link, with allowance for the 50\u201360 second activation time.\n\nYour consideration and understanding in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any further clarification or information is needed.\nThank you for your support and guidance.",

    "content": "@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini\nDear Sirs,\nI apologize for the inconvenience caused by reaching out again. I came to know that many students have received an email stating that the re-evaluation for Project 2 will be conducted today between 11 PM and 2 AM. However, I have not received any such communication on my end.\nI would like to bring to your attention that I actively helped several peers deploy their servers on Vercel and resolve various issues, and many of them received marks as high as 80. Unfortunately, my own record still shows as \u201cAbsent,\u201d despite the fact that I submitted the Google Form well before the deadline and my server has been live and running for over two weeks.\nFor your verification, I am attaching screenshots of my GitHub repository and the Vercel deployment dashboard, which clearly show the deployment.\nI sincerely request you to kindly consider this issue. This situation has caused significant mental stress, especially as I had already faced a grading issue in Project 1. The anxiety and uncertainty around my Project 2 score have negatively affected my focus during the end-term exam and viva for other projects as well. Receiving a zero in this project would only further impact my overall performance and morale, despite the genuine effort I have put in.\nI genuinely hope for a positive response and a fair re-evaluation.\nThank you very much for your time and understanding.\napi link : https://tds-proj2f.vercel.app/\ngit949\u00d7580 62.4 KB",

The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio).\n\n Suggested Fix:\nTo ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider?\nRecommended options:\n\nGoogle DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4\nCloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1\n\nThis can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment\u2019s networking configuration.\n\n Alternate Option:\nIf the DNS change isn\u2019t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead:\nhttps://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/\n\nPlease note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it\u2019s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay \u2014 but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs.\nBoth endpoints are currently active and return identical results.\n\nThank you so much for your time and support \u2014 I truly appreciate the effort you\u2019re putting into helping us succeed in this course!\nBest regards,\nSahil Raj",

I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment.\nAt that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct. Please keep in mind that publishing to GitHub requires some time; it\u2019s not feasible to expedite this process drastically, to my knowledge.\nI checked and noted that this question has been asked recently.\nAdditionally, I believe the image may show your server\u2019s IP address.\nThank you!\n10000638561920\u00d7858 139 KB",

Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\u2019\u201d\n}\n What Was Expected:\nThe question required developing a script that:\n\n\nParses a large, deeply nested JSON log file, and\n\n\nCounts how many times a specific key \u2014 represented by XF \u2014 appears in the JSON structure.\n\n\nIt was explicitly stated that:\n\n\nOnly key matches for XF are to be counted, not values.\n\n\nThe file to be used was:\nE:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json\n\n\n What I Did:\nI used the correct approach, parsing the nested JSON file and counting how many times the key XF appeared throughout the structure.\nHere\u2019s the actual response I got using this cURL command:\ncurl -X POST https://app.algsoch.tech/api/ \\\n-H \u201caccept: application/json\u201d \\\n-F \u201cquestion=\u2026How many times does XF appear as a key?\u201d \\\n-F \u201cfile=@E:\\data science tool\\GA5\\q-extract-nested-json-keys.json\u201d\nAPI Output:{\u201canswer\u201d:\u201c14602\u201d}\nThis indicates that my logic worked correctly and the key XF appeared 14,602 times, exactly as intended.\n What Went Wrong on API Side:\nThe API returned a parsing error, indicating:\n\u201cinvalid literal for int() with base 10: \u2018Error: Invalid JSON in the file\u2026\u2019\u201d\nHowever:\n\n\nMy file was valid JSON, properly parsed.\n\n\nThe actual issue seems to be on the API\u2019s side \u2014 possibly mishandling the file read or decoding before passing it to the evaluator.\n\n\nIt may have expected an integer but received a string-wrapped error or non-integer data, causing it to crash.\n\n\n Insight:\nIf the original question was about counting the key XF, my solution was 100% correct.\nHowever, if the question dynamically changed the key name or added extra criteria (e.g., only count if value == true, or only under a certain section), then the result might differ. But from the default XF-focused question, my logic and result match perfectly.",

I did till running the dockerfile but I needed evaluate.py sir, which I didn\u2019t get it. I got only 5 marks sir. Can you please check my code once sir and verify it as I have written the code and the dockerfile is running successfully.\nProject-2 Evaluation\nRegarding project 2 also, I have uploaded my code in GitHub and deployed my app in Vercel. But, I got 0 sir. Can you check my code once again and verify it? According to the guidance given, I deployed my app through Vercel. The app got deployed but I am getting 404 Error, even after trying any troubleshooting method. Maybe, Vercel is in development stage.\nSir, but I wrote the code and deployed, but I got 0 marks only. Please check it and guide me to get it corrected. Sir, due to the projects I got poor marks on TDS. Please, I request you to re-evaluate and give me correct marks.\nIn anticipation of quick response\nThank You",

Over the last few months, I\u2019ve built a personal project called \u201cVicky App\u201d \u2014 a smart assistant platform specifically designed to help students in courses like TDS,.\nThe system is capable of:\n\nAccurately solving over 90% of assignment-style questions using regex and phonetic matching\nDynamically executing the right code logic based on the student\u2019s input\nProcessing uploaded files such as Excel, PDF, CSV, and JSON\nDelivering instant answers, completely independent of ChatGPT or any external LLM\n\nYou can test the platform here: https://app.algsoch.tech\n\n What\u2019s in it for students:\n\nThey type their question, and the backend executes the correct solution automatically\nEspecially helpful for GA preparation, understanding problem logic, and reducing repetitive workload\nI\u2019ve made it free for the first 3 questions\nAfter that, students can access the full platform for just \u20b9199/month, which helps me cover system maintenance and hosting costs\n\n\n My Humble Request:\nThis is a tool I\u2019ve built with immense effort and love for this course, and I genuinely believe it can benefit many students.\nTo sustain the platform \u2014 hosting, APIs, file management, and backend orchestration \u2014 I\u2019ve introduced a small paid model after a free trial.\nI would be extremely grateful if you could test it once and, if you find it helpful, consider sharing it with upcoming students or mentioning it in a Moodle announcement.\nIt\u2019s built by an IIT Madras student, for IIT Madras students \u2014 with the sole goal of making their learning smoother, faster, and smarter.\nThank you so much for your time and support.\nWarm regards,\nVicky Kumar\nB.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras\n npdimagine@gmail.com |  +91 8383848219\n Portfolio | LinkedIn\nIt\u2019s a tool built by a fellow IITM student, with deep respect for the academic rigor of this program \u2014 not to replace learning, but to accelerate it.\nPlease let me know if you\u2019d like a walkthrough, or if any suggestions for improvements arise.\nWarm regards,\nVicky Kumar\nB.S. Data Science and Applications, IIT Madras\nnpdimagine@gmail.com | +91 8383848219\nLinkedIn | Portfolio",
