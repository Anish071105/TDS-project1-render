    "content": "Chat GPT has stepped up the game and I am excited \nNow I can not only generate the code, but can run it and ask it to fix the error with a single click. This changes software development and I guess we are moving in the direction we all know. It also makes this course a lot more important -  the number of new things that I have learnt from this course which I am able to directly apply to my day to day work is immense. Thanks to @s.anand and the entire course team who designed this amazing course\nI hope ChatGPT solves deployment next \nScreenshot 2025-02-07 at 7.08.14 PM1920\u00d71012 120 KB",
