The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.\nHowever, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed \u2014 resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I\u2019ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.\nHere is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1\nI kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I\u2019ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.\nThank you for your understanding.\n@Jivraj",
