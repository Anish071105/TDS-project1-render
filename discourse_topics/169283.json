    "content": "@carlton @Jivraj\nI did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect\nMy question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance\n10418 meters\n12287 meters\n10965 meters\n11149 meters\nWhose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would\u2019ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn\u2019t the case with this question)\nAlso, my question 4 was :\nAs an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.\n134483\n94774\n150666\n199711\nWhose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect\nSo is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren\u2019t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)\nKindly look into it\nThanks and Regards",
