    "content": "Apologies for the confusion. I realized that the issue was due to different time zones\u2014Java OPPE displayed IST (GMT +5:30), while TDS ROE showed AST (GMT +3). On the same day, I intended to delete my post on Discourse but couldn\u2019t find it, as it was still in draft mode. So, I deleted it. However, I was surprised to see the post today.\nI regret any inconvenience caused.",
