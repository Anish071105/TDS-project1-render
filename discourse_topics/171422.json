    "content": "Hello everyone,\nI have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with actual questions from the GA\u2019s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of \u2018test cases\u2019 so that we can try and fix our project?\nThank you very much in advance\nAryan Singh",
