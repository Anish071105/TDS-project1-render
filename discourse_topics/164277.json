It WILL change.\nDon\u2019t rely on the dataset being the same. It WILL change.\nLLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:\n\nYour code gives correct results reliably (i.e. try a few times)\nChange the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations\n\n\nYour AI Proxy usage resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.\nFor those who submit their code by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.\n",

The keys to a successful Project 1 are:\nDeliverables,\nand an example of the Evaluation has been provided.\nIf your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.\nScreenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am1764\u00d71764 374 KB\nPlease read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.\nSo the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.\nKind regards",

In other words after running the first task for example, has the new format.md been formatted correctly and matches the expected output.\nIn this case you would write out the the expected variable in the evaluate.py and see if result variable matches the expected. Then you can figure out what went wrong.\nKind regards",

    "content": "the model keeps wrong answer, it says uvicorn for uv and has no info on how to run uv even after explicitly giving instructions(basically an older model) , basic \u201cls\u201d command is also wrong, among other things. You can check your logs with respect to my api key.\nDo you think we could access a better model?\nMaybe Download Deepseek 70b or even 671b and create an api while y\u2019all run the model locally, in the long it would be cheaper for the course?\nbecause the model doesn\u2019t know basic commands after telling how to do it.\nSo if the model gives us wrong commands 2/3 times then how would we even solve the question.\nI spent a week on this just saying\n@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj",

For task A1, I am automating my server to remove the /data directory that\u2019s already present and run datagen.py again. Is this fine?\nFor /read endpoint, is there a standard for parameters like \u201cpath=/data/format.md\u201d or the parameter could be a plain english sentence like \u201cpath=show the data in format.md\u201d?\nAre we concerned about what\u2019s shown on the console if I run a /run command as long as it gets the job done?\nFor tasks A1-10, are the file paths provided in the project doc standard or even they\u2019re flexible? Ex. \u201cCount the number of Wednesdays in file /data/format.md, and write just the number to /data/out.txt\u201d\n",

    "content": "Hi Andrew,\nYou have done a great job with the Phase A tasks. Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy.\nI just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application.\nIn other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10  or 1/10 in the real evaluation.\nSo do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task.\nThat said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application).  Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty).\nHope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.)\nA word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.\nKind regards",

I have raised this issue before\nHence i moved to function calling, using local llms as cost-effective solution and it was quite robust.\nI just need to understand how the function should be general, maybe 2-3 tasks you could provide the general description along with all the ways one would query the agent llm(ie our project). This general function is what i need help with. Please kindly do the needful.",

    "content": "Hi Telvin\nYou have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2.\nScreenshot 2025-02-11 at 3.36.50 pm2078\u00d71276 305 KB\nIn our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50\nAs to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us!\nThe budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond.\nIn short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.\nKind regards",

I assume you have already achieved your answers, but I want to clarify this for someone who is facing this problem.\nThe thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks.\nWhat you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info. I was capable of doing it after pretending to be a working on a Cyber Security project, and other fake details which ChatGPT itself provided me with.",

For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with #  ). Create an index file /data/docs/index.json that maps each filename (without the /data/docs/ prefix) to its title (e.g. {\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...} ).\nHere expected output JSON \u201ckey\u201d is file name or file path without prefix /data/docs/ as prompt is bit confusing . when \u201cpath/to/large-language-models.md\u201d is given in example is actually referring to file path or filename itself is \u201cpath/to/large-language-models.md\u201d.",

It usually happens due to manual intervention with pip3 the user might break some system dependencies which require some python3 package. No need to worry about it.\nAnother Fix: try using a virtual environment which is highly suggested since there is no chance for you to interfere with the system packages.\ncreate a venv using python3 -m venv name_of_venv\nadd this line to your .bashrc in ~ folder as source /path/to/your/venv/location\nand run source .bashrc. This time no error occurs as you do everything in your virtual environment you can install anything python3 package using pip3 install package name.\nIt even happened for me\nScreenshot_20250215_1433573841\u00d71009 237 KB",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\nI\u2019m running into an issue with the AI Proxy embeddings endpoint while executing the A9 task. Every time I send a POST request to:\nbash\nCopy\nhttps://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings\n\nI receive a 401 Unauthorized response. This, in turn, causes my code to fail with a KeyError: 'data' because the expected JSON response doesn\u2019t include the \"data\" key.\nWhat I\u2019ve Tried\n\nToken Verification:\n\n\nI\u2019m using the AIPROXY_TOKEN obtained by logging in at aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev with my IITM email.\nThe token is passed in the header as follows:\n\npython\nCopy\n\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {AIPROXY_TOKEN}\"\n\n\nI added debug prints to confirm that the token is being used correctly (printing the first few characters).\n\n\nAPI Request Details:\n\n\nThe request includes the correct Content-Type: application/json header.\nThe payload is set as:\n\njson\nCopy\n{\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": [\"Test\"]}\n\n\nDespite this, the response status is consistently 401 Unauthorized.\n\n\nDebug Output:\nHere\u2019s a snippet of the debug output:\n\nbash\nCopy\nHTTP Request: POST https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \"HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\"\n\ud83d\udd34 A9 failed: 'data'\n\nThis confirms that the issue is with the authentication rather than our processing logic.\nWhat I Suspect\n\nThe token may be invalid, expired, or misconfigured.\nThere could be changes in the token permissions or endpoint requirements that I\u2019m not aware of.\nAlternatively, there might be an issue on the server side with token validation.\n\nRequest for Help\nHas anyone else encountered this issue recently? Could someone verify if there are any changes to the authentication requirements for the embeddings endpoint? Any insights or updated instructions on how to ensure the token is valid and has the proper permissions would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks in advance for your assistance!",

To test that my application would run everywhere, I first deleted all images from my local machine using podman rmi -a and then ran podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN $IMAGE_NAME with the appropriate variables set. This is as per the instructions provided here. But this gave me the following error:\nError: short-name \"freshbash/dataworks-agent\" did not resolve to an alias and no unqualified-search registries are defined in \"/etc/containers/registries.conf\n\nThe above is the format in which we have to provide the image name in the Google form. So, I was confused whether this would succeed during actual evaluation.\nThe only way its working right now is when I specify the image name to be docker.io/freshbash/dataworks-agent\nI\u2019m not yet very good with how containers work so some insights would be very helpful.

Coming from a non-coding background, I have learned a lot new things throughout this project building process.\n@carlton Sir, yesterday\u2019s session provided valuable insights into Method 1 (prompt engineering) for dynamically handling tasks. I was able to develop an application using this approach; however, due to submission time constraints, I could not verify all tasks (my bad). While I tested some tasks and found the results to be highly accurate, I was unable to validate everything thoroughly.\nTherefore, I submitted the function-calling approach (Method 2) instead.\nI sincerely appreciate everyone\u2019s guidance and support.",

    "content": "@s.anand @carlton\nDear Sir,\nI am writing to you in a state of distress and humility. An unfortunate mistake on my part has led to the upload of an incorrect Docker image link. When I checked the authenticity of the link, it showed an error, even though the GitHub repository link is functioning perfectly.\nI have poured my heart and soul into this project, dedicating countless hours and sleepless nights to ensure its success. The project has successfully passed both Test A and Test B, and I was thrilled to see my hard work paying off. However, this single error has left me devastated.\nI am pleading with you, with all my heart, to allow me to correct this mistake by updating the Docker image link. Alternatively, I humbly request that my application be reviewed directly through GitHub. Please consider this an exception, as I have worked tirelessly over the past two weeks to create an application that is 890 lines long.\nI beg for your understanding and leniency in this matter. This project means the world to me, and I am genuinely sobbing over this setback.\nThank you for considering my heartfelt request.\nSincerely,\nRishit Jain\n(24F2004595)",

I could say this without any hesitation that what I learnt in the past 10 days >> last 3 months.\nI really appreciate the idea of open internet type of evaluations, wherein, you implement things without any constraints, learning for the sake of implementing.\nDoing this project, I also found many new ideas wherein function calling can be used to solve new problems. I also learned many new things from enthusiastic peers like @23f1002382 and also got the chance to help a few.\nI thank the entire TDS team - @s.anand sir, @carlton , @Jivraj for their support throughout this amazing experience.\nRegards,\nPradeep Mondal",
