With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.",

You still need to  the submissions to get a score for the GA.\nThe actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or\non the Tools in Data Science introduction page.\nIts just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.\nAs far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. \nWe will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.\nNormally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.\nFor the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.\nKind regards",

Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.\nWe encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.\nkind regards",
