I recently explored the details of the extra credit project and found the problem statement and its clever framing both fascinating and challenging. While I’m eager to take it on, I feel my current skill set might fall short of the project’s demands. I’m committed to pushing my boundaries and would greatly appreciate your guidance on topics or resources that could help me prepare more effectively during my free time.
I want to ensure I can contribute something meaningful and engaging, even if the outcome isn’t perfect. If there are any recommended readings, practice problems, or areas of focus that you believe would provide a solid foundation for approaching this project, I would be very grateful for your suggestions.
Thank you for considering my request. I’m genuinely excited by the challenge and hope to make the most of this opportunity to learn and grow under your guidance.

@23f1002382 - The topics & resources that might help prepare for the projects at https://tds.s-anand.net/. It’s an evolving site. We keep adding whatever’s required that’s (a) new or (b) unknown to some students.
Please go through the content. Where you find gaps, please let us know. If it’s a need across multiple students, we’ll find / create the content around it.
Looking forward to your project!
