Screenshot 2025-02-01 132301331×314 12.3 KB
what is the error here?? sir @Jivraj
The image shows a screenshot of a coding interface displaying a JSON data snippet with fields for "id," "title," "year," and "rating," and a subsequent error message indicating that the expected and actual values for "rating" (2.9) match.

@22f3001315 @21f3002277 @24ds2000024 – please try again after reloading the page. The new error message will be clearer, like this:
Error: At [0].rating: Values don't match. Expected: "7.4". Actual: 7.4

FYI, we expect all values as strings, not numbers. That’s because the year can sometimes be a range for a TV series (e.g. 2021 - 2024) and the rating can sometimes be missing.

In Question 2, it is specifically said to filter the movies however, the evaluator is expecting a TV show there. Should we also include TV shows now?
edit:  This is an everchanging dataset, so will our answers be saved, as, this json might not be in this order tomorrow?

There is no submit button is available in below screen. Is it fine to save the link url only. Please clarify (unless we click submit button the log of Graded Assignment 4 remains red)

I have a doubt regarding the bonus mark. Suppose someone were to get 10/10 in the assignment, would their mark be recored as 11/10 or just 10?

Just a quick query on the Bonus mark.
Would this be added to the final grade? Say for example, Someone get a full score in the first 4 assignments. So the total comes up to 39.5/39.5, and would be converted to 0.15 or 15 marks. Would the bonus mark be additional to that 15 or would the score change to 40.5/39.5 and then get normalised to 15?

@JoelJeffrey It will be added to the GA4 marks, not the final grade. So, it’s roughly worth 0.15% on the total - not a full 1% on the total.

Have a step with your email id as its name. (Instead of checkout repository)
Also make sure you give read and write permission so it commits without any error

For Q10, I am extracting the text first using PyMuPDF (fitz) and then using markdownify to convert it to markdown and finally prettier. However despite trying changing it from PyMuPDF to other text extraction libraries, I end up getting

Incorrect. Try Again

Hi Tushar,
If you looked at the PDF you might have realised that students have been grouped. The question gives you a range for the groups 43-66. Including both groups implies both group 43 and 66 are included in your calculation.

Is there any way to crack this , I tired multiple time no improvement.
Also what does this " It is very hard to get the correct Markdown output from a PDF. Any method you use will likely require manual corrections. Reformatting with Prettier helps standardize the output format for comparison." mean.
image1327×743 41.6 KB
The image shows a coding exercise interface with a text input box where the user is asked to provide the markdown content of a PDF file, formatted using a specific tool.  The interface displays the question, user input area, feedback indicating an incorrect answer ("Incorrect. Try again."), and additional explanatory text.

In the question no. 10, I have tried numerous time to get it right markdown content but it was incorrect all the time.
I have tried these steps:
import pymupdf4llm
md_text = pymupdf4llm.to_markdown("/content/q-pdf-to-markdown.pdf")

import pathlib
pathlib.Path("output.md").write_bytes(md_text.encode())

Then i run this in bash
prettier --write output.md

And what i got frankly telling was far from this, I did some manual touchups, and this what i have now. This is the best version i could come up with. Saw the preview, it does matches with the pdf.
#Can someone please advise me a better approach?

On popular demand, I’ve made Q10 of GA4 easier (converting from PDF to Markdown). The question remains the same, but the check is more liberal and the error messages are more helpful. Please give it a shot now.
(FYI, one person did solve it. A colleague, not someone from the IITM DS program.)

Hello Sir, i tried but unfortunately after extracting the contents and formatting the contents and submitting it, it’s showing various errors like Missing links, Missing tables…
But on checking the file i wasn’t able to find any single table in the contents in that case what could be done to fix these errors?

Sir I checked the pdf file, there is only one place unorder list is given and the same is available in my answer. But the system throws error Missing List (I tried with other symbols * and + also) . Please inform me where I made mistake
image1108×271 5.87 KB
The image shows a code editor displaying an error message, "Error: Missing lists," below a list of four Latin phrases, each preceded by a hyphen.  The question "What is the markdown content of the PDF, formatted with prettier@3.4.2?" is also visible.

Do I need to add CSS?

I think the idea behind this font is to make it difficult for people to manually work on the markdown file from scratch. I guess they want us to use the tools (like PyMuPDF4LLM, markitdown) they provided as resources to convert pdf into a markdown and then may be we can do some manual intervention to make it to the result as the scraping tools are not 100% accurate.
Could be another reason too. TAs’ can feel free to pitch in.

There are only four texts which look like link texts in the pdf.
All four properly coded in link markdown syntax, in the preview, they appear as  link texts same as in pdf.

Link text
Even after chaning all the 4 texts which appered in blue color in the pdf to link texts,
below error is still observed.
Error: Missing links
Did anyone else face same issue ?

Also, no text in the pdf looks like a code block.
But, Missing Code error was seen and after changing one of the paragraph by using markdown code syntax that error is gone.

Appreciate any suggestions on the link error.

I am also facing the same issue. What is the problem here?
image1788×908 77.9 KB
The image shows a coding assessment interface with a question requiring the creation of a JSON object from weather data,  displaying a partially completed answer, an error message indicating a property name mismatch, and a scoreboard showing a score of 9/10.

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

This is the only thing which worked for me.
@carlton Sir, can I suggest to replace the snapshot of example output which expects the year to be an integer and the ratings as to be floats (instead of actual evaluation which expects them to be strings). Also, it would help to clarify that “Movie 1” should carry the numerical prefix as reported in IMDB.  The current example on the portal is:
image1580×196 4.81 KB
The image shows a code snippet in JSON format, displaying a list of movie entries.  Each entry includes a unique ID, title, year, and rating.

Sir, In Graded Assignment - 4 >> Q2, the year I extracted appears as “2024,” whereas the expected value on the portal is “2024–”. I have manually adjusted several values based on the expected format. This issue is specific to the year field.
I use different classes to extract values for various fields. Could there be any other element on the portal affecting this extraction?
In Q4, one of my classmates is encountering a “root property” error despite using the same extraction method as I do. Upon checking, I found that this issue occurs because the city’s time is displayed as the previous day compared to our time. The portal results seem to be based on the city’s actual time rather than IST.
I would appreciate your guidance on these issues.

Good idea @23f2005138 and thanks. I fixed this. The example now reads:
[
  { "id": "tt1234567", "title": "Movie 1", "year": "2021", "rating": "5.8" },
  { "id": "tt7654321", "title": "Movie 2", "year": "2019", "rating": "6.2" },

… with the year and ratings quoted.

I guess for the year part, there are certain series having multiple seasons, for which hyphenated “years” are given.
For the particular instance - “2024–”, it appears another season/part is announced, thats why it is written that way.

Thanks @21f2000709 for this information. I figure out where i made mistake. During writing console code I added to remove non numeric values in year field which i guess removed that hyphen (“–”). I will rectify that.

GA 4 Q2
My JSON matches the titles of the movies as in the website, but in portal it is showing error and expecting something different from what is given in the website. How to handle this ?
image501×151 37.6 KB
image1226×258 13.2 KB
contradiction :
" 2. Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey" (in web page) & ( delivered by the JSON)
" 2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" (expected in portal ) & ( raising error statement )
Regards
GOVADHANAN N
The image shows a movie listing for "Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey," including a movie poster thumbnail, the title highlighted in red, the year (2023), runtime (1h 24m), a user rating of 2.9 stars (33K votes), a Metascore of 16, and an option to rate the movie.
The image shows a programming error message indicating a mismatch in JSON data; specifically, the expected value for "title" is "2. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey," while the actual value is "25. Battlefield Earth".  The error message highlights the expected and actual values.

For this question, you may use the Google Colab file referenced in the assignment. This file will provide you with the date and description. Additionally, you can generate a weather location ID for the city specified in your assignment. Using this ID, you will obtain the weather URL, which you can then use to verify the date and description.

Titles (from the output json) should be replaced by the titles which shows in the error message “Expected”. It can only be done manually. There may be multiple titles need to be translated by this method.
Please refer the instruction.

I face the same error, also thinking of issueDate, the value seems to be constant in every loop inside forecasts array (is it because the data is issed on that particular date) that gives same issue date key across the json outcome.

That is perhaps to ensure we don’t manually write the markdown for the pdf. Converting the pdf to markdown and getting the correct output is extremely hard, I tried doing that multiple times yet wasn’t able to get that right by the original method.
But since it is mentioned that the GAA is hackable and we are allowed to do so, for some of the questions, therefore you can try solving that by establishing a breakpoint in the sources and then write the code in the console to get the expected output.

Write the code referencing the provided collab file and make sure to use the API key
The output actually changes once in a while so you might need to run the code a few times before getting in right

Just copy paste the expected value in place of actual value in json. Keep doing this eventually it would be the answer would be correct.
This is a format issue when the json is scrapped from the browser.

Request help on Q4 aboutBBC weather data, the instructions in the question tell us to use BBC broker API and get issueDate & enhancedWeatherdescription value pairs. However, it seems there are only 2 unique values of issueDate (not the expected 14 days)
Please clarify, sharing code and output below for reference.
Code:
import requests

url = "https://weather-broker-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/en/forecast/aggregated/" + getlocid('Bogota')
response = requests.get(url)
json_data=response.json()
print(f"The number of days data is {len(json_data['forecasts'])}")

weather_data = {}

for i in range(len(json_data['forecasts'])): # Use range to create an iterable sequence of indices
  issue_date = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['issueDate']
  weather_description = json_data['forecasts'][i]['summary']['report']['enhancedWeatherDescription']
  weather_data[issue_date]=weather_description
  print("Iteration No. " + str(i))
  print(issue_date)
  print(weather_description)
  
print("Final Weather Data json below")
print(weather_data)

you have to manually change for a few mismatch.



 s.anand:

@21F1005510 Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles.
Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.

The API is returning 14 days of forecast data, as evidenced by the output However, the issueDate values are not unique for each day. Instead, they represent the time when the forecast was issued or updated.
In your output, there are only two unique issueDate values:
2025-02-08T04:00:00-05:00
2025-02-08T16:01:58-05:00
This means the forecast was updated twice on February 8, 2025, once at 04:00 AM and again at 4:01 PM (both in EST timezone) …To get a unique weather description for each day, you  need to modify your approach by using the actual forecast day for each day instead.

I posted this error message but now the first issue got resolved but I am still keeping it in my post so that if anyone faces same issue, they can try if they can fix it similar to how it worked for me.
Please help with the second issue.

For Q8, the workflow is running on Github and commiting the scraped results to the json file (which is so amazing for me btw!). But I am getting this error for my public repo.
How it got resolved: I set up fixed time for cron schedule instead of every 5 min. Now it works.


Error: No daily scheduled triggers found in workflows.


I had all correct results for Q1 to Q7 till yesterday but it keeps giving errors even when I reload same file for some questions. Do I need to keep addressing those errors or if once correct and saved, I can ignore those?

Can anyone help me with the 10th question. Whatever I changed with the code , it is asking something. I checked that these words are not present in the pdf itself
The image contains a question asking for the markdown content of a PDF, along with a text box showing sample markdown text,  highlighted sections, and an error message regarding missing words.

I didn’t get any error for Astana.
The error may be due to incorrect loops in your code that’s why it’s going out of range, check for that.

The image shows a Jupyter Notebook code cell containing a table of weather data and a line of code converting the table to a JSON object using the `to_json()` method with the `orient='records'` argument.  The interface includes options for generating code, viewing plots, and creating new interactive sheets.

Agreed and I have tweaked my approach to get the correct answer. But I feel the question instructions should be adjusted accordingly - the question says to get every issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription key value pair - but only 2 such pairs exist ; whereas in the final answer it is forecast date & weather description total 14  pairs.

Open the BBC Weather website.
Press Ctrl + Shift + I.
Select the ‘Network’ menu.
Select ‘Fetch/XHR’.
Type ‘Karachi’ in the input field on the website. Do not press Enter while entering the location; just type the location. Pressing Enter might cause ‘location?api_key=…’ to disappear.
‘location?api_key=…’ will appear in the inspect menu.
Double-click it to open a web page (https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key={api_key}). This will give the API.
Alternatively, single-clicking ‘location?api_key=…’ will open headers where you can see the Request URL and the API key.

The image shows a webpage displaying weather forecasts from BBC Weather alongside a browser's developer tools network tab, which includes a waterfall chart and a table detailing network requests.  A Windows activation prompt is also visible at the bottom of the screen.

first convert it roughly to md file then use ai and tell it to add (all the errors one by one). and slowly it will solve all the errors
yes i know it is not the correct way to convert pdf to md file but its just a way to trick the checking system.
but i have an issue it gave me error that it does not contains the word “bash, javascript, whole  redesign, net, suasoria” which is not in the actual pdf, but i added it and it worked. it was just pure trial and error.

The IMDB and weather questions was a pain along with the 10th question, wasted so much time @s.anand , the questions were nowhere tough, it was the problems with the evaluation part i had spend hours just to  sit and correct the JSON file and no comments on the 10th question’s part.
I am fine with the academia being challenging to study not the evalation making me manually edit solutions

i 'm here for the bonus marks,
But since i am here. Just want to appreciate the course and your efforts towards this.
We need more “teachers” like you, who really puts an extra effort in the course.
And i have never seen any course cool as this,

like appreciating tweaking things, using dev console to tweak things, keep the code checks on client side (and as S Anand’s Student i have leveraged that freedom  , gave client side answer checks’s code to o1 and it reverse engineered the minifed code, and lots of question were solved by that only, but really curious on how others are doing this)
keeping the cutting edge tech in course, like function calling from OpenAI.
( i have seen some students solutions, they were using regex to solve that problem )

Is it safe to skip Q4 for those who got the city named Nur-Sultan, since it has been renamed to Astana, and the answer for Astana is incorrect in the portal?

@s.anand
There is possibly wrong evaluation in q6 as it is taking in 2nd latest link as the correct answer. I might be wrong, but the latest one is giving me incorrect evaluation while the 2nd latest is giving me the correct score.

@Abhay222 @22f3002184
if you look closely the expected value is 2024-  and actual that you are supplying is 2024.
Difference ? your value does have a - and a space at the end.
reason ? you might be scraping it ? trim() or maybe using innerText to get tag’s text ?

For question 2 getting Error: At [8].title: Values don’t match. Expected: “9. Un matrimonio di troppo”. Actual: “9. You’re Cordially Invited” But this movie is not found when searched by name


the movie may have  different title on IMDb (perhaps in another language) according to region which is why there isnt an exact match u can manually format it to get marks

Alright so in Q4 of W4, We have to extract weather forecast data from bbc servers for a given city. The city I have been given Nur-Sultan is not present in the bbc data base, it appears the city is now known as Astana and is listed in the bbc database as Astana.
Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database, all of my attempts to extract data for it were meet with failure. So I extracted the data for Astana and pasted it in the portal but that doesn’t work as well and throws the following error “TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘id’)”
What am I suppose to do? @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Screenshot 2025-02-09 1759481823×850 82.3 KB
Below is the data for Astana that I was able to extract, Since Nur-Sultan doesn’t exist in the bbc database:
{
“2025-02-09”: “Partly cloudy and a moderate breeze”,
“2025-02-10”: “Sunny intervals and a moderate breeze”,
“2025-02-11”: “Sunny and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-12”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”,
“2025-02-13”: “Light snow and a fresh breeze”,
“2025-02-14”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-15”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-16”: “Light snow and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-17”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-18”: “Sunny intervals and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-19”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-20”: “Light cloud and a gentle breeze”,
“2025-02-21”: “Sunny and a moderate breeze”,
“2025-02-22”: “Light snow and a moderate breeze”
}
The image shows a coding exercise with a timer, score, and a question requiring the student to construct a JSON object representing a weather forecast based on provided instructions and example.  The student's response includes a `TypeError` indicating an error in their code.

Check if you are using table formating where there is a table, also there is perhaps a code block in the pdf where a small section of text is in different font than the rest.

Here are the Discourse IDs that replied to this post. @carlton could you please add 1 mark to them in the GA (not the overall score)?

Please include only those are enrolled this term, obviously.
If they didn’t attempt GA4, please include them anyway and give them 1/10.
If they got 10/10 already, please add 1 mark anyway and give them 11/10.

As you can see in this screen shot i already tried this question and getting error so i posted it on discourse. But still i did not get any marks for attempting this question.
i got only 9/10.
The image shows a discussion forum post containing a question about a `NameError` in Python code related to fetching weather data,  along with a code snippet and error traceback displayed within the post.  A scoreboard displays "168/360," indicating a progress metric within the forum.

Hello @s.anand @carlton Sir,
As can be seen, my roll number is present in this list (21f2000588) and in GA4 I have got 10/10 but unfortunately, that bonus mark hasn’t been added (as can be seen from the score displayed on the dashboard). So I request you to add that bonus mark to the total kindly.
Hoping for a positive response.
Thanks & Regards

if a student has 10/10 and his name is in the bonus list, how would that look like in the dashboard?
I don’t think it is added in my case.

It will show up as 110  marks. Bonus marks are for all discourse posts on this thread that Anand has identified as valid. I have provided operations team with the update corrected scores. You will start seeing them in the dashboard soon.
Also these are the list of students that have been affected by Nur-Sultan in their questions. These will get an automatic mark for that question if they attempted it. Note that this is not a bonus mark. This is a free mark.

For those who didn’t submit but still need to practice the questions like to check if the answer is right, or cross-check the solutions for GA 4 and GA 5, is there a special link where the portal just checks the answer and says right or wrong. I wasn’t able to do GA4 or even try to attempt GA 5 before deadline, but i would like to go through the process of submitting etc. is there any link or solutions for GA 4 and GA5.

is there anyway to practice the assignments and check answers even though the deadline for the assignment passes? or is the answer given somewhere just for learning sake. I  understand that each set of students get different questions. @Jivraj @carlton @s.anand
