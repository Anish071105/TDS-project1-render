Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.
(roughly 3 days before end term).
Kind regards

@carlton @Jivraj
What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

You were sent an email about it. With the peers to review. It came from the official TDS email.
You were sent an email on the 1st of April.
Kind regards

Hi @carlton sir,
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.
Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

The image shows a Gmail inbox view displaying several emails with subject lines related to peer reviews and bonus marks, containing links to Google Forms for submission.  Each email includes multiple hyperlinks, which appear to be unique submission portals.
