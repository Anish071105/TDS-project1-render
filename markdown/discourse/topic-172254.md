‚ÄúStudents are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.‚Äù
So I did. 

 Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments 
Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.
But let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶
It was my Labrador who did the actual work 
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn‚Äôt even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.
He growled at broken APIs.
I took the credit. 

 Message from the Dog Developer:

‚ÄúThank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.
But I am personally offended by one thing‚Ä¶‚Äù


‚ÄúHow dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?
I skipped it ‚Äî just like many ‚Äî because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.
I demand justice. And a belly rub.‚Äù

 Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework.
You get the grade. They get the rage.

I think you feed your dog desi ghee instead of pedigree
