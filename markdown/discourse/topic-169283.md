The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?

@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
I have similar concern
For Q1, I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

And got the following output:
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.

Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

and got the following answers:
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).
image278×216 9.19 KB
The image shows a multiple-choice question interface with four options; each option presents a metric name (Mileage, AvgDistance, Mileage, EngineCapacity) paired with a numerical value.  One option, 'AvgDistance: -0.05', is selected.

I used a python script to get the solution to quesiton 1 of week 6 graded assignment. It matches three options. Is this a bug or like we then need to analyze using the pearson coefficient to determine which option is the correct one

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
Dear TDS Team,
There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.
Thank you for your support.

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.
For instance:

forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

Can you please provide any update ASAP as the deadline for this GA coincides with Quiz 2. With many ambiguities unresolved it’s hard to solve this and study for Quiz 2 (and do offline college work even though that’s not your problem).
Thanks

@Jivraj  - Can you please check answer choices for Q7 for GA6 where no choices are matching with the answer. The answer is coming to around 11.5 kms which is 11500 meters.
Q.A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Pine Pines Junction : (26.5596,-99.5336) ;Maple Fields Station : (26.4212,-99.4597);South Glen Crossing : (26.5962,-99.5243);Cedar Creek Retreat : (26.56,-99.4519) & Central Command Post Location: (26.4644,-99.4771) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Pine Pines Junction. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance

@carlton @Jivraj
My question 7 for GA6 is :
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance
Whose options provided are :
10418 meters
12287 meters
10965 meters
11149 meters
However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)
I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

I solved it in colab but options are getting mismatched there…kindly clarify this issue..
The image contains Python code that calculates and displays the distances between four communities and a central command post, using the `haversine` library.  The code then sorts and prints the communities in ascending order of their distance from the central command post.
The image contains a multiple-choice question with four options, each presenting a sequence of community names.  The question involves determining the optimal evacuation sequence using a "nearest community first" strategy, given the coordinates of four communities and a central command post.

Hello Sir,
Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from @carlton sir we should select the absolute maximum value.
image978×393 23.3 KB
Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum.
For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,
image748×431 17.5 KB
So shouldn’t it be -0.13?
The image shows a multiple-choice question with four options presenting Pearson correlation coefficients for mileage, average distance, and engine capacity on price retention, along with a scoreboard indicating an incorrect answer and a score of zero.  The correct answer is also displayed.
The image contains a correlation matrix heatmap visualizing the relationships between four variables: Mileage (km/l), Average Daily Distance (km), Engine Capacity (cc), and Price Retention (%).  The heatmap uses color intensity to represent the strength and direction of correlations, with numerical values displayed in each cell.

In my case Please note the above two questions are asked to calculate pearson correlation coefficient for KTM brand and for maharashtra and Karnataka states.
I have used excel to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient. Below the values I got for each question. Please verify.
|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for Karnataka||
-0.026685695
|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||
0.003953219
|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for karnataka||
-0.010839295
|pearson correlation coefficient between impact of Mileage and Price retention for kTM brand for maharashta||
0.029128825
|pearson correlation coefficient between average distance travelled and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||
0.013019585
|pearson correlation coefficient between average Engine capacity and Price retention for kTM for Maharashtra||
-0.056866212
The image shows a multiple-choice question with four options related to Pearson correlation coefficients for mileage, average distance, and engine capacity;  the correct answer, 'Mileage: 0.03', is revealed after an incorrect selection, resulting in a score of 0.

I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect
My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance
10418 meters
12287 meters
10965 meters
11149 meters
Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)
Also, my question 4 was :
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.
134483
94774
150666
199711
Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect
So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)
Kindly look into it
Thanks and Regards

In Q4 , neither which regression model to use is given nor the what random state to use is given. I tried linear regression, random forest regression but it is giving   answer which vary each time I compute, also, the option values are quite close.

The image shows a multiple-choice question with four numerical answer options, a "No, the answer is incorrect" message, and a score of 0.  The question asks to develop a forecasting model for the 2027 resale value of a specific motorcycle model using historical data.

Just to confirm, were the answers shown on the portal correct because I’m getting the same score as shown in the portal.
