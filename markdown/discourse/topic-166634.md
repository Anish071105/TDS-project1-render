The image shows a laptop screen displaying a GitHub Actions page, showing three workflow runs with details such as timestamps, status (failed), branch, and actor.  A sidebar displays options including "All workflows," "Daily Commit," and various management settings.

It is working in repo
The image shows a laptop screen displaying a GitHub repository page for "my-repo" by user "Sakshi6749".  The page shows file listings, commit history, and repository statistics including zero stars and zero forks.
