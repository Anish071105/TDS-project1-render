The image shows a student's progress view in an online learning platform, displaying a list of modules (Development Tools, Deployment Tools, Large Language Models, Data Sourcing, Data Preparation) with assignments and projects, including a scoreboard showing "Your Score," "Peer Average," and "Median Score" for a graded assignment.  The "Graded Assignment 2" is marked as "Not Submitted."
