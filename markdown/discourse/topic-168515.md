Good morning sir,
I want to request that you open the previous GAs to solve the questions and check for the answers. I donâ€™t wish for them to be graded, but I would like to work with the portal and validate my answers for the questions stated in the GA itself. This would be of great help and could help prepare the upcoming ROE.
Thank you for considering my request.
Regards.
@carlton @Jeevesh
