Hi @carlton,
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

The image shows a spreadsheet containing two entries of PPI industry data, one for Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations, and another for Calcium channel blockers; both are for pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing and not seasonally adjusted.  The spreadsheet displays data points including Series Title, Series ID, Seasonality, Survey Name, Measure Data Type, Industry, and Item.

@Jivraj
In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

The image contains a description of a spreadsheet's contents.  Specifically, it states that Sheet1 includes columns labeled "Series ID," "Item," "Year," "Month," and "Value".
The image shows a table with columns labeled "Series ID," "Year," "Period," "Label," and "Value," containing numerical and alphanumeric data.  Two rows of data are visible, showing Series IDs, years, periods (e.g., 2023 M01), labels (e.g., 2023 Jan), and corresponding numerical values.

PCU3254123254127114
Calcium channel blockers


PCU325412325412MM
Miscellaneous receipts

Antacids


PCU325412325412SS
Secondary products

ACE inhibitors



Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Monthly Price Indices for Segments (Two-year data)

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

The image shows a Google Sheet with a list of pharmaceutical items in column A and their corresponding numerical values for the year 2023, broken down by month (M01-M05) in columns D-H.  The sheet also includes a "SUM of Value" row and highlights several rows with red arrows.

Hi Tanya,
Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.
Kind regards

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi @carlton sir,
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.
Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

The image shows a Gmail inbox view filtered to display emails containing "peer review" in the subject line.  Several emails contain links to Google Forms, each with a unique alphanumeric identifier in the URL.

Sir,
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.
In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?
Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest and yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.

You have two options. Get in touch with the peer (you have their email address), this is the recommended approach. Or you could give them zero because you were not able to evaluate their submission.
