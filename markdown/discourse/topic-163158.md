Where are the weekly videos?
Where and what is the assignment?
I’m confused.
The image shows a graded assignment interface with a single multiple-choice question asking if the student has viewed the assignment, a submission button, and a list of troubleshooting tips for accessing the assignment.  The interface also displays a course module list and a due date for the assignment.
