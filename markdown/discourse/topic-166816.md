@24ds3000061 @22f2001532
Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.
GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.
Kind regards

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem )

Here sir for me it is showing absent for GA2 but for others the score is showing.
The image displays a course progress report for a "Tools in Data Science" course, showing assignment scores for four weeks with a button to navigate to the course page.  The scores are presented as a list of weekly assignments with numerical scores and an "Absent" indication for one week.

Hi Team,
I have attended the Graded Assignment for Tools in Data Science for the week 4 and the saved scores says i have got 2 marks. ( TDS 2025 Jan GA4 - Data Sourcing).
But in the evaluation it says i have not submitted the GA4 from this course. Can you please clarify the same.
Attached the screenshots for both

because the previous score that you received was what you scored after the deadline. We had accidentally given students marks to students who submitted after the deadline. Here is the evidence.

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.
Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.
The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.
Kind regards.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.
The image shows a graded assignment interface with a current score of 0,  a "Recent saves" section displaying previous scores of 8, and two questions requiring Markdown documentation and image compression.
