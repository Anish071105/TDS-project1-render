Is this something to worry about?
The image shows a web page interface for an online quiz titled "TDS 2025 Jan GA5 - Data Preparation," displaying instructions, a scoreboard of recent saved attempts with scores, and buttons to check answers and save progress.

This is nothing to worry about because as you can see in the Recent saves section, it has your score history. We have your entire submission history because we log that.
Kind regards
