@carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.
Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

The image shows a Google Sheets access request page;  a text box prompts the user to request access, providing an optional message field, and displays the currently signed-in user's email address.
The image contains a numbered list of two tasks; the first describes creating a Google Sheet workbook and naming it according to a specific convention, and the second task involves sharing the workbook with a specified email address for submission.
