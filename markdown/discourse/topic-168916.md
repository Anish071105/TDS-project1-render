You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25
Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.
The image shows a table with columns for email, URL, result, type, and message; each row shows the result of a check on a given URL,  including the type of check performed and a corresponding message.

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.
Kind regards
