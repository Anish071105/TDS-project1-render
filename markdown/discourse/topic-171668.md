@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
Hi,
We have 6 days for ET. I request you to share module weightage (if it’s not secret).
Please release mock as early as possible because this term course content has been changed so pyqs won’t help much.
Thanks
Sujay D

@carlton, please release the mock or give us the proper resources. The resources in the course introduction and the pyqs have no similarities. Many questions come from other topics, such as MLT and many others. Those who didn’t complete it find it too difficult. Please don’t keep us in delusion.

The Tuesday and the Thursday session will cover end term including a mock.
End term is usually very easy for TDS. A look at prior end terms is a good indicator of how easy they are.
Kind regards

@Carlton With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion.
I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns?
Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?

I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session.
