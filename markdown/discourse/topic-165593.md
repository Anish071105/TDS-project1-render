In the discussion Thread for Project 1, it was said that there will be live sessions conducted for the project, however, there hasnâ€™t been one specifically for it.
If there are live sessions that will be conducted, can we have some hands on tutorial for the project ?

Hi Sakthivel,
We are still covering the precursors for Project. Once we cover the required topics then we will have sessions that work through the project with the students.
Kind regards
