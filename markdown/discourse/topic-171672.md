The image contains a text-based report detailing the results of five prerequisite checks for Project 1, showing a final score of 0 due to failure to meet all requirements.  A failure to meet minimum requirements is explicitly stated to prevent submission evaluation.

I checked your github repo MIT License file is named as Licenese.md but standard naming for License is LICENSE or LICENSE.md (with all caps).
The image shows a GitHub Docs page with instructions on adding a license to a repository, including screenshots of the interface elements involved in the process, such as file name fields, a "Choose a license template" button, and a preview area.  Numbered steps guide the user through the process.

So, should I edit the filename now, or will you count it as missing?

I submitted the project within the deadline, and I ensured that all requirements were fulfilled, including correctly adding the MIT License file. The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.
However, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.
Here is my GitHub repo for your reference: GitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.
Thank you for your understanding.
