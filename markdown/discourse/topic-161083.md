For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working
The image shows a forum post containing a question about file manipulation in bash.  The question includes a downloadable zip file, `q-move-rename-files.zip`,  and asks about the output of a specific bash command.

Hi anant,
Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.
In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

Hi Anant,



 21f2000370:

image1296×158 7.29 KB


Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.
The image contains a teal background with a large, white, sans-serif letter "A" centered.  No other elements are visible.
The image contains a forum post showing a question about moving and renaming files,  including a downloadable zip file named "q-move-rename-files.zip" and a bash command prompt.

In attempting the third question, I’m unable to download the npm package as it requires docker. When trying to install docker from the installer, it freezes in the verifying package stage. Can somebody please help solve my problem?

Hi Hisham,
Its described in the question. There is a hidden element hiding somewhere after that question. You would have to inspect the DOM to find it.

Hi manmeet,
I don’t know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.
When I logged in today it says score is 0.
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?
If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to  the submissions to get a score for the GA.
The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or
on the Tools in Data Science introduction page.
Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.
As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. 
We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.
For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.
Kind regards

Thanks @carlton.
I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)

Hi @Nelson
Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).
Kind regards

It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value.

I am stuck with the last question. SQLite question.
It gives the error:
Error: Got [[121510.39]]...


Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed.

Hi Shouvik,
Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.
Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

Try copy pasting exact symbols — OR † OR € Can you share code in code block, it’s difficult to read symbols that are present.
Also have a look at what all_content variable contains, see if there are some problem with content.

@Samra this is almost certainly due to a (typically corporate) firewall or antivirus. Please try with a personal laptop from a public / home network.
(I face this problem at office often. Once, our company’s firewall blocked our own company website )

        <div class="bar baz" data-value="17">
          <div class="baz foo" data-value="29"></div>
          <div class="foo" data-value="20"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="bar foo baz" data-value="71">
          <div class="foo" data-value="48"></div>
          <span class="foo" data-value="30"></span>
          <div class="foo bar" data-value="90">

            <div class="" data-value="48"></div>

Oh, good catch, @23f2000237 and @siva.bhaskaran - I made a mistake in the evaluation script. It included the span.
I fixed it. Note: None of the earlier answers are affected, i.e. if you got it right earlier, it’ll stay right.

It’s hackable. It’s possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That’s allowed.

What does exactly mean, if someone could elaborate without giving it away, please?

Hello Gentlemen Instructors,
In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,
In one of the classes, you said that there is something  - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??
Thanks and regards,

This will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.

Do remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.
Please check this out and let me know if there are any bugs. Thanks.

@Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845
If you are on Windows Powershell
Then instead of sha256sum you can simply use Get-FileHash
Send the output of the npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md to a text file eg. output.txt and then use Get-FileHash on powershell with the output.txt and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.
You might be able to pipe the data directly to Get-FileHash but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.
Kind regards

@s.anand Sir
as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.
I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.
Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?
If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.

@iamsarthak – as long as you don’t save again, your score will stay 10, even if I modify the evaluation script  
We don’t re-evaluate previous results in the graded assignments.

@s.anand sir,
Question 15 is under the section for linux
I got the file which needs to be processed to answer the question
image583×167 4.09 KB
I can solve this now using pandas.
From learning perspective, is this question aimed at making students to use something like awk or is it fine if i can carry on with pandas?
The image shows a table listing four text files, displaying their length in bytes, date of creation, time of creation, and file name.  The data is presented in a simple, text-based format resembling a command-line output.

@23f2000573 You can solve it with any tool you’re comfortable with, including pandas.
But since you already know how to do it with pandas, I suggest you explore how to do it with something like awk (or any other tool) to get a broader exposure into different approaches.

@Rohitkumar7463 The hash code is exactly what you see under the column Hash,
7E…E5
Thats the Hash code for the file output.txt
A Hash is a nearly unique representation of some data within some range dependent on the type of hashing algorithm and the amount of unique pieces of data that need to be encoded. (just my colloquial definition of it, i am sure you are able to ask GPT to give you a much better explanation)
Kind regards

Time Zone Issues with the “List Files and Attributes” Question
quick heads‐up about Question 15 (the one asking for files at least 8143 bytes, modified on or after Sun, 19 Nov 2006, 7:38 am GMT‑5). I’m physically in a different time zone, but I eventually discovered the question seems to expect you to be located in India and to interpret that files date/time accordingly.
I got the correct answer once i localized the files timestamp to IST.
thanks

Hi Arnav,
I tried your script on your dataset.
Problem might be you are not executing grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum in correct directory, you would need to execute it from all_files directory also there should not be any extra file other than that gets generated.

Hi Saravanan,
I noticed an issue with your submission. In the question, there is a name Bob, but it doesn’t appear in your answer after applying the required sorting. Since the data for each student is dynamically generated and unique, the answer you submitted seems inconsistent with your dataset.
We encourage collaboration among students, but copying answers is not acceptable. Instead, I suggest reaching out to your friend to understand the script they used, run it on your dataset, and ensure you fully grasp the solution.
kind regards

I ran this directly in the console and got the correct answer.
// Select all  and  elements with the ‘foo’ class
const fooElements = document.querySelectorAll(“div.foo, span.foo”);
// Initialize a variable to store the sum
let sum = 0;
// Iterate through the selected elements
fooElements.forEach(element => {
// Get the ‘data-value’ attribute and convert it to a number
const value = parseFloat(element.getAttribute(“data-value”));
// Add the value to the sum
if (!isNaN(value)) {
sum += value;
}
});
console.log(“Sum of data-value attributes:”, sum);

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

Hello Sir,
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.
I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of 80 out of 100. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “absent” for this particular assignment.
I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?

The image shows a web page interface displaying a score of 0 for a concluded exam, along with a "Recent saves" section listing three previous attempts with a score of 8.
The image shows a course announcement for a "Tools in Data Science" course, indicating that the Week 1 assignment is absent.  The announcement is displayed on a dark-red background with a polka dot pattern.
