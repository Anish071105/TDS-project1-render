Sir,
The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!
The image shows a file browser interface, possibly from a version control system like Git, displaying a project's file structure including folders and files such as `_pycache_`, `venv`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `MIT LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `test.txt`.  A commit history section lists several commits with timestamps and descriptions such as "Final Submission" and "First submission".
The image shows a text-based automated evaluation report for Project 1, indicating pass/fail statuses for several prerequisites including Docker image presence, Github repository details, and MIT license, resulting in a final score of 0.

Hi @22f3000585
Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).
Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs
Kind regards

Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!
The image contains a text-based message indicating a failed submission to a system due to missing repository, MIT license, and Dockerfile.  A GitHub repository link is included in the message.

Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.

The image contains text providing instructions for assignment submissions, specifying requirements (no "MIT" in LICENSE, no Dockerfile) and stating that only the latest submission will be graded.

@24ds2000125 @22f3000585
I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.
But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.
Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.
These things do matter when done at scale.  Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.
Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.
We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.
I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.
Kindest regards

Sir,
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.
Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

The image contains a text-based pre-requisites check displaying the results of four checks related to Docker and Github repositories, with a pass/fail status indicated by 1 or 0 respectively.  Each check item lists the specific requirement and its corresponding pass/fail result.
The image contains a text-based error message from an automated system, indicating a submission failure for a GitHub repository (https://github.com/22f3000585/tds_project-1.git) due to the absence of a repository, an MIT license, and a Dockerfile.
The image shows a file submission history with a list of files (including `_pycache_`, `venv`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `MIT LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `test.txt`), their corresponding actions ("Final Submission," "First submission," "Create LICENSE," "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE"), and timestamps.  Each file entry also displays the number of commits associated with it.
