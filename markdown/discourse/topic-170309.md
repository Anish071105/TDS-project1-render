Sir,
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi @Sakshi6479,
You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.
That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.
Kind regards
The image contains text describing a bonus mark opportunity for students.  It specifies that participation in a Discourse discussion thread titled "GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]" will award one bonus mark.
