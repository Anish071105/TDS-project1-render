Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread
Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective assignments
Why? 
If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?
Too many Questions for LLM 
True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer
What We need from YOU ü´µüèΩ
Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?
How?

If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful

## Student Assignments Directory Structure

Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
- A `.txt` file with the question statement.
- A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.

### Example Directory Structure
