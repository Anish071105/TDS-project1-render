Good Morning Sir,
This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)
I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.
@carlton
The image shows a text-based evaluation report for a project, listing five pre-requisite checks, four of which failed.  The report includes a pass/fail status for each check and details the required files and repository accessibility.
The image contains a text-based evaluation report for a Project 1 docker image submission, including a list of seven files (evaluation log file, docker log file, server start log file, evaluation script file, data generation file, docker orchestration file, and solution script), download links for some files, and a note about scoring and potential adjustments.

Apologies for that,
The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.
Kind regards

Hi @carlton,
I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:
First Evaluation Email1511×724 76.2 KB
Second Evaluation Email1247×681 37.5 KB
My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:
GitHub repo
Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and assistance!
The image shows an email containing project evaluation results for a Docker image submission.  The email includes a numbered list of log files and scripts,  links to these files, and a final score based on the evaluation.
The image shows an email displaying project evaluation results for "TDS Jan 25 Project 1," indicating failure due to unmet prerequisites including the absence of a Dockerfile and MIT license in the GitHub repository, despite a publicly accessible Docker image.  The email includes a numbered list of prerequisites and a scoreboard showing a final score of 0.

Hi,
Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?
My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds
Thanking You
Just attaching the mail I recieved.

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:
tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())
You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.



Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. 
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.…

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below

Sir, But I couldn’t run the last command you gave,
uv run evaluate.py --email <any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

As I dont have evaluate.py
But, the DockerImage is built and is running without error sir.
Please guide me after this sir
Thank You So much sir
The image shows a terminal window displaying a Docker build log, including SHA256 hashes, build steps with timestamps, and a final success message indicating the application is running on a specified port.  The log also shows a command used to run a Docker container.

The image shows a terminal window displaying the output of a Docker build process, including a list of build steps with associated SHA256 hashes and timestamps, and a final message indicating the successful startup of a Uvicorn server.  The bottom of the image shows a command used to run the built Docker image.

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science


    Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
